## Fisheries Context

There are two marine extractive sectors in Chile, the artisanal and the industrial. 

The artisanal sector correspond to fishing activities performed by vessels smaller than 18 meters in length and 50 tones and by individuals harvesting resources in the intertidal zone (i.e. harvesting drift alage or extracting benthic resources). Artisanal fishers and their vessels must be registed in the National Records of Artisanal Fishers (RPA, acronym in spanish) kept by SERNAPESCA. The RPA list which kind of species an individual is allowed to extract and in which area. It also categorize fishers as boat owners, fishers, divers or shore harvesters as well as gender and age of the registered fishers. Most artisanal fishers are organized at the local level in unions, economic associations or cooperatives and in federations at the national level. 

Landings are self-reported to SERNAPESCA [completar bien esto, explicar como se obtienen las bases de landings y precios en SERNAPESCA].

The artisanal sector has exclussive access to the first five miles and the first mile is reserved for vessels below 12 meters in length. Benthic fisheries in Chile, operate in a system of territorial users' rights for fishing, in which fishers associations are granted with exclussive access to benthic resources in a specific fishing ground and co-manage the stock under SERNAPESCA's supervision. The rest of the fishing grounds are open access but are subjected to species restrictions. Artisanal fishers usually target multiple species and use a combination of gears. 

Most artisanal fishers in Chile are comercial fishers. They usually sell their catches near to landing points in setlements known as *caletas* for direct human consumption. The rest of the catch is sold through middle-men to production facilities and other sellers for both direct and indirect human consumption (**Figure 1**).

The industrial sector correspond to activities performed in large [escribir despricion similar basada en SUBPESCA/Actividades reguladas]

## Top domestic marine, capture fisheries based on landed volume

### Industrial sector 

We used landing records from SERNAPESCA to compute the fisheries that contribute the most to the industrial catch. **Figure 1 and 2** shows the landings for the top five fisheries in terms of volume over the last four years for the industrial and artisanal sectors, respectively. 

```{r importing clean landings SERNAPESCA, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE}

landings_reg<- read_csv(here("clean_databases/landings_SERNAPESCA.csv")) %>% 
  filter(region != "national") %>% 
  mutate( tons = as.numeric(tons))

```

```{r top 5 fisheries in terms of volume, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## General
landing_reg_general <- landings_reg %>%
  group_by(year, species, subsector) %>% 
  summarise(tons = sum(tons, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  data.frame()

## Artisanal

top5_catch_art_per_year <- landing_reg_general  %>%
  filter(subsector== 'artisanal') %>% 
  arrange(year, desc(tons)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  top_n(5, tons) %>% 
  data.frame()

## Industrial -- Including fabric vessels. 

top5_catch_ind_per_year <- landing_reg_general  %>%
  filter(subsector %in% c('industrial', 'fabric_vessel')) %>% 
  group_by(species, year) %>% 
  summarise(tons = sum(tons)) %>% 
  arrange(year, desc(tons)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  top_n(5, tons) %>% 
  data.frame()

```


```{r plotting top fisheries per sector per year for industrial sector, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Top five fisheries in terms of landing volume over the last four years for the industrial sector based on SERNAPESCA's landing data."}

# I am not including 2014 for now because we are missing one database for industrial landings for 2014 (landings per species and region in national waters)

main_catch_ind <- 
  ggplot(data = top5_catch_ind_per_year, aes(x = year, y = tons, fill = species)) +

### Artisanal sector

## Top domestic marine, capture fisheries based on landed value

### Industrial sector

There are not official statistics of value for the industrial sector as this is confidencial information. 

### Artisanal sector

### Aquiculture

Main finsheries according to the harvest produced by aquacultere each year.

#### Importing data 

```{r importing clean aquaculture SERNAPESCA, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE}

harvest_reg<- read_csv(here("clean_databases/aquaculture_SERNAPESCA.csv")) %>% 
  filter(region != "national") %>% 
  mutate( tons = as.numeric(tons))

```

####  Main harvest species per year

```{r}
## adding amount of harvest per year at a national level

harvest_reg_total <- harvest_reg %>%
  group_by(year, species, subsector) %>% 
  summarise(tons = sum(tons, na.rm = T)) %>%
  data.frame()

## top 5

top5_havets_per_year <- harvest_reg_total %>%
  arrange(year, desc(tons)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  top_n(5, tons) %>% 
  data.frame()
