# Background

Latin American nations include some of the world’s most important producers of seafood from capture fisheries and aquaculture and, with a high (51%) proportion of net seafood production traded locally [@ref], domestic fisheries remain highly important for national food security across the region. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that Latin American countries consumed around 6.2 million tons of fish in 2015, averaging a per capita food fish consumption of 9.8 kg/year [@FAO:2018vf]. The contribution of fisheries to food security and livelihoods is particularly pertinent given the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [@UnitedNations2018], where adequate management of marine fisheries can be directly linked to the achievement of goals related to decreasing hunger and poverty throughout the world [@Singh:2017ds]. There has been a further increase in attention to global capture fisheries due to the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations on fishery subsidies disciplines [@WTO:2018vv], as these are partially intended to avoid trade and operational distortions that may threaten local food security in maritime nations. 

In 2016, total fish landings in Chile and Peru, two of the world’s top fishing nations, averaged 8 million tons per year [@Fishstat]. In Peru, the seafood sector generates over US 1.7 billion per year, supporting over 200 thousand jobs. Moreover, Chile’s aquaculture production is among the largest of the world1 and fish meal and salmon exports generate over US$2.2 billion per year. Despite comparatively lower catches, Brazil’s fisheries sustain thousands of local families in coastal areas 5-6, and inland captures along riverine systems including the Amazon basin are among the largest in the world. Aside from seafood production volumes, fisheries in Latin America are extremely important as a source of employment and livelihoods along coastal regions, and further inland through value chains. Around 90% of all motorized fishing vessels in Latin America are part of the small-scale fisheries sector (SSF) and are under 12m length. Despite supporting 120 million people [@FAO:2015vu], this sector is among the most marginalized groups in the region 7, despite it being critical to achieving sustainable development goals [@UnitedNations2018], as highlighted by the recent FAO small scale fisheries guidelines that explicitly link the sector with food security, poverty eradication, and social [@FishStatJsoftware:2016uf; @FAO:2015vu]. 

Given the increasing pressures on vulnerable populations, including climate change but also rapid national and international policy and market shifts, it is imperative to highlight the critical importance of particular capture fisheries for meeting domestic seafood supply. This knowledge can help guide future policies to ensure economic development does not jeopardize health and livelihoods, either in fishing communities or at the national scale. 

# Methods

The objective of this project is to determine the most important species for domestic seafood consumption (regionally, as possible) produced by wild capture fisheries in Brazil, Chile, and Peru, and their relationship with local employment. Given that seafood is a widely traded commodity and that aquaculture has steadily increased market supply, meeting this objective involved using species-specific data on domestic catches, aquaculture, and seafood imports and exports to highlight the most important species and fisheries that contribute to local and national food security and livelihoods. 

## Analytical framework

Given the nature of fisheries data and governance systems, each of the nations considered presented unique analytic challenges (see ‘Data sources’), but a consistent methodological framework (Figure 1) was used to maintain consistency in methods and comparability of results across nations. 

Based on the best available data in each country, total seafood supply was estimated as the sum of per-species production of domestic catch and aquaculture (minus exports), plus the sum of species net imports. Catch statistics were separated by sectors whenever possible, including artisanal, industrial, and subsistence catches. In the case of domestic catch, inputs to aquaculture are subtracted from production (similar to exports); this is particularly relevant for large industrialized fisheries for small pelagics that are almost entirely reduced into fish feeds. The distribution of consumption (demand) of this seafood supply was based on regional (as available) estimates of seafood consumption per capita and regional populations. An important additional aspect for the critical analysis portion of the project was the linking of fisheries landings with available regional socioeconomic and governance indicators, providing a basis for discussing relative vulnerabilities to potential changes in seafood supply.

 grid.raster(img)
```

The framework proposed in Figure 1 is similar to that proposed by FAO [@FAO:2017vf], which has also been adapted and applied to specific national fisheries [@Sumaila:2007gf]. We further incorporate species-specific accounting in our approach, which is challenging due to the differences in aggregation in data reporting, for example when landings are reported by species (e.g., “Whiteleg shrimp”) and trade statistics by product name (e.g., “Shrimp frozen,” “Shrimp fresh”). However, this modification is critical for identifying specific species or species groups that are important for national food security.  

The following sections provide detailed methods for estimating i) net seafood supply and ii) revenues for key species in each country. This focuses on production from capture fisheries, but also includes aquaculture and trade supply. This analysis was applied across all countries using different datasets. Results will vary within countries according to the dataset (source) used.

## Estimating National Seafood Supply

We followed the framework described above (Figure 1) to estimate total seafood supply. The model included fish production  from for wild (marine) domestic catch, farmed fish, and trade. (Unless otherwise noted, ‘fish’ is used here to refer to all marine organisms.) In addition, estimations accounted for discards at sea and biomass losses due to processing (Table 1).

    "Landings from wild capture production (catch minus discards).",
    "Total domestic fish supply. Total amount of fish produced in the country.",
    "Net domestic fish supply. Total amount of fish produced in the country, minus exports and discards.",
    "Total fish supply. Total amount of fish in the country (NDFS plus imports).",
    "Net seafood supply. Effective amount of fish for human consumption in the country (TFS for human consumption, minus processing waste)."
  )
) %>% 
  kable("latex", booktabs = T,
        caption = "Description of variables used to estimate the national seaffod supply.") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
   column_spec(2, width = "15cm") #%>% #wraps text in column2
  # kable()

```

The model first estimated the total domestic catch of fish supply per species (*i*) from wild captures and aquaculture as follows:

<!-- $${TDFS_i} = {C_i} + {A_i}$$ -->

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  TDFS_i = {C_i} + {A_i}
\end{equation}

Note that, to avoid double-counting fish production, domestic catch that is fed to farmed fish was subtracted from overall production. This was done as possible given available country information and context (i.e., this may be more of an issue for some countries than others). Then, net domestic fish supply was estimated from fish landed (catch minus discards), aquaculture and exports as:

<!-- $${NDFS_i} = {L_i} + {A_i} - {E_i} $$ -->
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  NDFS_i = {L_i} + {A_i} + {E_i}
\end{equation}



<!-- $${L_i} = {C_i} - ({C_i} * {\lambda_{d,i}} )$$ -->
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  L_i = {C_i} - ({C_i} * \lambda_{d,i})
\end{equation}


where the second term in Equation 3 allows for a calculation of total discards in each country. In Equations 4 and 5, we assume that all imported seafood (we do not include imports not for human consumption, e.g., fish meal) is ready to be consumed and thus do not include losses from processing. We also assume that all aquaculture production is for human consumption and that none of this production is discarded, though processing losses do occur as in production from capture fisheries (e.g., farmed and wild caught shrimps would receive similar processing).

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  TFS_i = {NDFS_i} + I_i
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  NSS_i = [L_i - (L_i *\lambda_{d,i} + A_i)] * \lambda_{d,i} - E_i + I_i
\end{equation}


## Estimating National Economic Participation

Fishing revenue integrates the different ex-vessel price that fish landings can have depending on the final destination, i.e., for direct human consumption (DHC) and indirect human consumption (IHC). Therefore, total revenue (R) is estimated in the SAU database as follows:



```{r NEE_Variables, eval = T, echo = F}

# $\\delta{m}_1$

data.table(
  Symbol = c(
    "$\\beta$",
    "$\\alpha$",
    "I",
    "RI",
    "E",
    "FR",
    "NT"
  ),
  Description = c(
    "Ex-vessel price for catch landed for direct human consumption",
    "Ex-vessel price for catch landed for indirect human consumption",
    "Imports. Economic value of imported fish",
    "Re-Imports. Economic value of fish products re imported in the country",
    "Exports. Economic value of exported fish",
    "Fishing Revenue. The total revenue for that species provided by the fishing activity",
    "Net trade. Economic value of fish traded considering both exports and imports"
  )
) %>% 
  kable("latex",
        booktabs = T,
        caption = "Description of variables used to estimate the national economic participation.")

```


Fishing revenue integrates the different ex-vessel price that landings have, depending on the final destination: direct human consumption (DHC) and indirect human consumption (IHC). Therefore, total revenue (R) is estimated in the SAU database as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
  FR = \sum_{i = 1}^n (L_{i}*\beta_{i})*\beta P_{i} + (L_{i}*\alpha _{i}) *\alpha P_{i}
\end{equation}

Activities after landing fish are an important contributor to national economies, and these indirect and induced economic impacts were estimated based on economic multipliers for each country  included in *Dyck et al (2010)* in their estimation of fishery contributions to national GDPs [@Dyck:2010ez].

In addition to landings data, we used FAO statistics [@FAO:2018vf] database to determine the value (USD) of fish and crustaceans, mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates imported and exported by Brazil, Chile and Peru. We estimate the net trade (NT) as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
NT = (E-I)-RI
\end{equation}

## Data descriptions

This section outlines the sources, types, and limitations of available input data for the models described above. Data searches and analyses were undertaken at two levels. The first collated intergovernmental and global (e.g., FAO, SAU) datasets that were comparable across countries but involved various uncertainties. The second involved in-country data searches and validation and, though data quality varied across countries, results represent estimates using the best available information for each country.

The first approach using intergovernmental data is a somewhat broad analysis when one considers the uncertainties associated with global fisheries data [@refPauly;@Garibaldi].  Nevertheless, these are the best available official data and provide general and readily comparable trends across nations. This also provides a good starting point for highlighting key areas and species of interest that can then be addressed during in-country searches. The intergovernmental analysis used three main datasets:

1. *FAO* - The United Nations Fish and Agriculture Organization through the FishStatJ platform [^1], provides landings by country, year, and species (or species groups); imports, exports, and re-exports (i.e., exports of imported fish after processing) by country, year, and product name; and aquaculture production by species. All datasets report in tonnes, and trade information includes both weight and USD values. Landings data are available from 1950 to 2016, and other data from the early 1970s; all data are provided to FAO by member nations, either through fisheries ministries or in-country consultants.

[^1]: UN-FAO FishStatJ, available at http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en.

2. *SAU* - The Sea Around Us project maintains a global dataset of “reconstructed” fisheries catches for every country from 1950 to 2014[^2]. The dataset for each country was estimated using the FAO data as a baseline, on top of which estimated unreported catches and discards are added based on available literature and expert consultation [@Zeller]. Catches are furthermore divided by sector (industrial, artisanal, recreational, subsistence) and, as possible, split into specific species when FAO reports species groups. Data furthermore include yearly ex-vessel prices by species [@refTai].

[^2]:The Sea Around Us, available at www.seaaroundus.org

3. *Fish reduction data* -  A recent study estimated the proportion of fish landings used for human direct consumption and fish meal and fish oil, by species and country [@Cashion:2018]. These estimates were based on the SAU database and available country-specific information. 

Data extracted from SAU for Chile included the Juan Fernandez Islands, Easter Island, and Desventuradas Islands. For Brazil, landings data included Fernando de Noronha Island, St Paul and St.Peter Archipelagos, and Trindade & Martim Vaz Islands.

For this level of analysis we used the FAO database to estimate the total landings (tonnes) of Chile, Brazil, and Peru averaging the values from 2012 to 2014, the last year with data available for all databases, including  all fishing sectors (Industrial, Subsistence, Artisanal, Recreational) and various taxa.

### Country-specific data, Brazil 

Brazil has over 7 thousand kilometers of coastline including most of its states and one of the largest river networks in the world, with the Amazon River alone covering over 7 million km2 . Fisheries resources in Brazil are extremely important for income and food security of millions of people throughout the country. Despite enormous social and economic importance, many fish stock are overexploited and in risk of collapse. According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Environment, 80% of fish stocks are over exploited or fully exploited. This signals the urgency for sustainable management of fisheries in order to guarantee the livelihoods of fishers, improve food security in the country, and conserve marine biodiversity.

There has been no official national collection of fisheries statistics in Brazil since 2008, a serious issue which was highlighted throughout our interviews with researchers and managers in the country, and which posed a great challenge to this study. Information such as how much the country produces, how much it consumes or even the number of fishers in the country is very sparse. In an interview with one of the most renowned fisheries scientists in Brazil, Dr. Fabio Hazin, he pointed out that there are between 400 thousand and one million fishers in the country. Additionally, he pointed out that data from FAO on Brazilian fisheries is mostly a copy of production reported in previous years. Therefore, our analysis for Brazil required an extensive interview effort and contacting of people from all fisheries sectors to find out what data is available. We gathered six different databases representing various fisheries sectors and further conducted an extensive literature research. We also identified other potential sources of information that we were not able to obtain in time for this study.

1. *SIGSIF* - Data obtained from the sanitary inspection services of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture. This database includes all seafood processed by fishing industries with a federal inspection certificate required to commercialize seafood products to different states of Brazil and for export and import. It is a rigorous inspection program, where one of the requirements is to report all seafood (by species) that enters each company, whether from imports or domestic production, for a total of 47 companies. It includes both aquaculture and wild caught products from both freshwater and the oceanic species (2016-2017).

2. *CEAGESP* - The largest wholesale open seafood market in Latin America is located in the city of São Paulo and is run by a state-owned company where sellers and buyers from all over the country gather to trade seafood and seafood products. We obtained information on all the seafood products traded in the market by species and price, for 2016-2017.

3.  *MDIC* - Import and Export data from the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade. This database contains all seafood imported and exported in Brazil, available to us for 2014-2017.

4. *State fisheries landings* - 1.	Fisheries landings data from three states of Brazil where there is continuous data collection and data are publicly available. These three states (São Paulo, Parana and Santa Catarina) are located in Southern Brazil and have a continuous data collection program sponsored by Petrobras in partnership with local universities. Petrobras is required to collect landings information for insurance purposes and has made some of its data publicly available for research projects. For São Paulo, data is available since 1998, for Santa Catarina since 2000, and for Parana since 2016. In addition to these detailed datasets, we were able to obtain total production data from the state of Amazon from 2009 to 2017.
 

5. *IBGE* - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. This federal institute is responsible for surveying the country to provide basic information on all social aspects of Brazil. We gathered two pieces of information to inform our analysis: household food consumption (last survey dates from 2009 and 2010) and income by region of Brazil (2017). 

6. *Fishing Permits* - 1.	- Two sources of data: 1) Total number of registered fishers in the country from the extinct Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (2003 - 2013). 2) Number of registered fishers by state from a study conducted during an investigation of fraud in the fishers’ insurance system (Ministério da Transparência, Fiscalização e Controladoria-Geral da União - CGU, 2017).

### Country-specific data, Chile

1. *SERNAPESCA* -SERNAPESCA - The Chilean National Service of Fisheries is the main entity in charge of keeping track of landings and other fisheries and aquaculture related data in Chile. Most of their data is available on their website but we also obtained additional databases upon request[C^1]. We accessed their databases on landings from wild-caught and farmed fisheries, first transaction prices (ex-vessel price) for artisanal fisheries, and landings used in different types of sea products. These databases provided information at the species and regional level. We also downloaded their data on the geographical distribution of production facilities and the types of sea products they produce. We issued data requests on SERNAPESCA’s portal to obtain more detailed information. Via this method, they provided us the national record of artisanal fishers (RPA), which lists current registered fishers and boats, and the national record of industrial vessels (RPI), which lists current registered industrial vessels. The RPA informs the region, gender and age for each artisanal fisher as well as the species-specific permits they hold. Together the RPA and RPI provide information on artisanal and industrial vessels, including length and storing capacity. SERNAPESCA also provided the number of employees of each gender per processing facility.

[^C1]: Chilean National Service of Fisheries. Data available athttp://www.sernapesca.cl/informes/estadisticas

2. *Aduanas Chile (Chilean Customes)*. is the main entity in charge of keeping records of imported and exported goods in the country. We accessed their exports and imports data by product and region via their website. Each product in the original exports and imports datasets is identified through an ID number that matches the name of the product in a code known as the Arancel Aduanero. Most products provided details on the species or groups of species involved.

3. *IFOP* - The Fisheries Development Institute is a private entity that advises fisheries management based on permanent biological, environmental and economic monitoring, and scientific reasoning. Although most of the data collected by IFOP pertains to stock assessments and biological indicators, they also generate economically relevant statistics. We reviewed their most recent annual report on the economic monitoring of Chilean fisheries for 2015. It includes databases and estimates for employment. We also extracted data from their monthly reports on exports of fisheries products, which are based on ADUANAS's data.  
4. *CCB* - The Chilean Central Bank (*Banco Central de Chile*) is the entity in charge of establishing the Chilean currency. To fulfill its function it monitors the main economic indicators per economic sector. We accessed their data on sectorial GDP (including fisheries) for each region. 

5. DataChile (www.datachile.com) is an online platform that integrates, visualizes and distributes public available data from Chile. They also inform their visualizations with data from the ADUANAS Chile and national surveys. Using their visualization tools we extracted information on fish products imports for different municipalities.

6. We reviewed several reports from other national agencies like the Undersecretary of Fisheries (SUBPESCA), NGOs and scientific publications to complement our analysis.

### Country-specific data, Peru 

Data from the following governmental institutions were used to characterize Peruvian capture and aquaculture production, internal and international trade of seafood products, apparent seafood consumption and the contribution of seafood to the national economy. The following governmental institutions provided data for this study (or include it on their official webpages):

1. *PRODUCE* - The Peruvian Ministry of Production (Ministerio de la Producción del Perú), reports fisheries landings by species and line of production (e.g., canning, curing, freezing, etc.) on annual statistical reports available on their webpage[^3]. They also report aquaculture production, yields by line of production, internal trade, and apparent seafood consumption [@PRODUCE 2012; 2013; 2015a; 2015b: 2016; 2017].

[^3]: Peruvian Ministry of Production (Ministerio de la Producción del Perú; PRODUCE), Available at <http://www.produce.gob.pe>

2. *IMARPE* - The Peruvian Marine Research Institute (Instituto del Mar del Perú; IMARPE), reports ex-vessel prices on a daily basis by species and landing site. This database was provided by Juan Carlos Riveros (Oceana Peru), and can be found at IMARPE's website [^4]. Moreover, IMARPE has published the results of several national surveys of small-scale fishermen by fishing gear [@Guevara-CarrascoBertrand2017]. These include information on the number of fishers by gear.

[^4]: Peruvian Marine Research Institute (Instituto del Mar del Perú; IMARPE) Available at <http://www.infomar.imarpe.gob.pe>

3. *SUNAT* - The Peruvian Customs Agency (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria), reports seafood imports and exports by ‘custom code’, which group together products by type and sometimes species.

4. *INEI* - The Peruvian Institute of Statistics and Informatics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática). Reports the results of the annual household survey (ENAHO – Encuesta Nacional de Hogares). These include information regarding per capita seafood consumption by species, product type and region.

# Results

The results section is divided in two main subsections representing analyses using intergovernmental datasets (*Intergovernmental results*) and national datasets (*Brazil, Chile, Peru*). The results for each subsection follow the same structure and include a general overview, estimates of seafood supply and consumption, and contributions to employment and income.

## Regional Overview

### Fisheries Context

#### Wild Caught Fish

Results from the intergovernmental data show a clear dominance in total fisheries landings by Chile and Peru over Brazil, even though Brazil captures more different species than the former. However, Brazil is a main exporter of seafood, importing more than double that of Chile and Peru (Table 3).

The FAO database on fish landings (wild caught) present different trends between and within countries (Figure 6). In Brazil, the highest average catch for any one species between 2012 and 2016 was Brazilian sardinella (*Sardinella brasiliensis*), representing 8.9% of the country’s average landings. Sardinella is a very popular fish in Brazil and supports a big industry (see Brazil’s section below); while catches are variable, they remain relatively high and the FAO data is most likely under-reporting this species’ landings. For both Chile and Peru, the species with highest landings was anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) with a 28.7% and 76.5% of total national landings, respectively. Anchoveta is mainly used for fish meal and fish oil, with only a small proportion used for human consumption; therefore, both Chile and Peru’s biggest fisheries in terms of landings are most likely not major contributors to national food security.

Fish landed as part of subsistence fisheries are all destined to direct human consumption and therefore, represent an important source of protein for coastal communities and fishers themselves in Brazil, Chile and Peru. While FAO’s data does not differentiate between sectors, we can use the SAU dataset (as recently as 2014) to get a sense of subsistence landings in all three countries (Figure 7). It is worth noting that our comprenhension of this sector is highly limited, as data describing it is limted, highly uncertain and mostly incomplete. As a result, subsistence fisheries’ capture production is highly under reported and its relevance to national food security is highly underappreciated by government authorities.

According to SAU data, subsistence fisheries are more important in Peru and Brazil, althou their numbers are quite low. In the case of Chile, subsistence fisheries are relatively limited as most fishing communitites have the option to sell and/or eat their catch. For Peru, marine subsistance fisheries are not that important for food security. However, that is not the case for freshwater subsitance fisheries (see Peru critical analysis). The low subsistence volume in the data can also be product of the high uncertainty around these fisheries. The category “Marine fishes not identified” reflects this, as it represents most of the subsistence landings for Chile and Peru, and are very important to Brazil. In the case of Brazil, the fact that mullets (genus *Mugil*, *Tainha* in portuguese) are the main species group in subsistence data is not surprising as this group is known to represent an important source of protein for fishing villages and is common in local dishes.


Finally, it is worth mentioning that only three species (Chilean jack mackerel, eastern pacific bonito, and whitemouth croaker) are found in both the top landed species in FAO data and in subsistence captures in SAU data. This comparison highlights potentially important differences between commercial and food importance of species at local scales, thought it should be taken with care as both datasets could differ in the species-specific level of detail (e.g., taxa vs broader groups).

#### Fish Trade 

In addition to the internal fish production, Brazil, Chile and Peru all import and export fish (Table 4). Brazil leads all three countries in terms of fish imports with Atlantic salmon and Alaskan pollock in the top of the list in terms of net trade (Imports-Exports). The only net trade of Chile and Peru equitable to Brazil's are Tunas, Chilean jack mackerel, and Pacific chub mackerel (in the case of Peru), all other products are substantially lower than Brazil's products.

### Estimating National Seafood Supply

Because seafood can be supplied by different sectors, we combine the multiple datasets collected for this study to include aquaculture, wild capture, and international trade. Names in the FAO trade data were standardized as possible to match the taxa and species groups in the catch and consumption data. Results suggest that the main fish group destined for food in Brazil is tilapia, salmon in Chile and anchoveta in Peru (Table 5). However, as discussed below (see each country’s section) these results might not represent the main food sources as regional dynamics (e.g.subsistence fishing, fishers interactions) might not be captured by international data sources by country. These differences might result from regional and local dynamics (e.g.subsistence fishing, fishers interactions) not being accuarately captured by international data sources. The latter might also be subject to bias driven by methodological assumptions included for catch reconstructions, or to error from data manipulation and incorrect data sharing between national government fisheries institutions and FAO. Finally, because FAO trade data is arranged by product (e.g.American and European Lobsters Homarus.spp, whole, frozen) it is very challenging to match such products with the actual species or species group. 

Based on our results, Brazil’s seafood supply comes mainly from aquaculture of tilapia, cachama (*Colossoma macropomum*), and shrimp, and imports of Atlantic salmon, Alaska pollock, and herrings, sardines, and anchovies. In the case of Chile, the main sources of seafood are landings of species such as jumbo squid or mackerels, and aquaculture with species such as Atlantic salmon and Chilean mussel. Finally, Peru’s national seafood supply comes mainly from landings with the main three species beign anchoveta, squid, and jack mackerel.

As previouslly mentioned, matching FAO-trade data with captures can be quite challenging. As a matter of fact, when comparing the estimated NSS from international and national datasets in Peru, we found that, althou the species composition is not that different, quantities change a lot. This is mainly because as seen in **Table X**, the model was not able to account for any positive net trade of the species due to the missmatch between the FAO trade and wilde capture data.

```{r NSS_Complement, eval=F, echo=F}

x<- International_D %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Species,"mackerel")) %>% 
  group_by(Species, Country) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(Aquaculture:Discards),

  arrange(Country,Species)

### Estimating National Economic Participation

Fisheries are important to local and national economies of most Latin American countries. Of the case study countries, the fishing sector (counting only landed values) has the highest GDP contribution in Peru (2.3%) and lowest in Brazil (<1%). By using a multiplier developed by Dyck and Sumaila [@Dyck] we can estimate the total impact of the fisheries industry (supply chain) in the country’s GDP. Such multiplier (2.05 for Latin american countries) boosts the GDP contribution to 2.6% in Chile and 4.7% in Peru (Brazil maintains under 1%).


```{r Per_PIB_T, eval =T,echo=F}

# PIB de World Bank
data.frame(
  Brazil = c(2209,2616,2465),
  Chile = c(218.5,252.3,267.1),
  Peru = c(153.9,176.7,192.6)
) %>% 
  gather("Reporter","GDP",1:3) %>% 
  group_by(Reporter) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>% 
  left_join(SAU_Totals_Plot,
            by = "Reporter") %>% 
  filter(Variable == "Landings_Value") %>% 
  mutate(
    GDP_Des = ifelse(Reporter %in% c("Chile","Peru"), GDP*1000000000,GDP*100000000000), #Billion
    "Landed value" = Totals,
    "Total Economic Impact" = round(Totals*2.05,1), # From Dyke and Sumaila
    "Household Income" = Totals * 0.56,
    "% of GDP" =round(`Total Economic Impact`/GDP_Des*100,3)
  ) %>% 
  select(-Variable,-GDP_Des, -GDP, -Totals) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(2:4),funs(round(./1000000000,2))) %>%
  rename(Country=Reporter) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Fisheries contributions to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Total economic impact includes indirect and induced effects of the fisheries sector. Data based on economic impact multipliers reported in Dyck and Sumaila (2010) for each country. All values in USD billions.", 
    booktabs = T,
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
    )

```

In terms of economic contribution of specific fish landings, Brazil’s most valuable fishery between 2012 and 2014 was *Umbrina canosai*, a croaker fished in the southern part of the country. For Chile, the most valuable fishery was anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*). Peru’s most valuable fishery in 2014 was the Peruvian scallop (*Argopecten purpuratus*) (Figure 8). International databases describing ex-vessel prices are also subject to error and biased estimates, as was the case for capture production (FAO) and reconstructed catch (SAU). Thus, the most valuable fisheries per country might also differ when estimates use national and international datasets (see Peru - National Economic Participation).

Trade is an important component of fisheries. From the countries analyzed Brazil was the only country to have an overall net import of fish. Brazil spends more money importing fish than what it makes from producing it and exporting that production. Conversely, both Chile and Peru have a trade surplus from their fisheries, with Peru the most “profitable” country (Table 7).

### Fisheries Context

#### Wild Caught Fish

##### Global Databases (FAO and SAU)


As previously mentioned, there are no national-level fisheries statistics data in Brazil since 2008. Therefore, the country-wide assessment was only possible using the SAU and FAO datasets. While these datasets provide information regarding landings by species, it is worth mentioning that they are far from realistic. In our meeting with Dr.Fabio Hazin, he pointed out that data from FAO on Brazilian fisheries is mostly extrapolated as-is from production in previous years, when reliability was already questionable. The figure showing the top 5 species fished in the country gives a clear picture of such extrapolation (Figure x)

```

According to both the FAO and SAU data, Brazil’s fisheries capture has been declining since 2012, though there has been increasing aquaculture production. The SAU database accounts for unreported catches in Brazil [@REF] and estimates around 50 thousand tonnes more captures than reported in FAO. These captures are important since they are mainly caught by the artisanal sector, hence contributing directly to food security [@SAUBrazil] (Table 8). 

```{r Brazil_Totals_T, eval=T,echo=F}

    "Exploited Species" = n()
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  tidyr::spread(Variable,Totals) %>% 
  select(-Year) %>% 
  mutate(Year = seq(2010,2016)) %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2014) %>% 
  left_join(SAU2010,
            by = "Year") %>%

  ) %>% 
  kable(
      caption = "Summary of results for Brazil. Database used: SOFIA-FAO and SAU. Exploited species in quantity, other variables represent thousand tones"
    )

```

According to the SAU database *Macrodon ancylodon*,*Micropogonias furnieri*,*Sardinella brasiliensis"*,*Umbrina canosai*, and Ray fishes (*Baitoidea*) are the most landed fish between 2010 and 2014 (Figure 9). It is very likely that these fish are consumed in the country representing an important source of food.

###### Santa Catarina

The state of Santa Catarina is one of the main fisheries producers in the country. This state is home to the largest fisheries port in the country, **NAME**, concentrating most of Brazil’s industrial fleet (Figure 9). Landings data from this state are available since 2000, although from 2014-2016 catches are underreported due to lack of funding. Historic production from Santa Catarina has been over 100 thousand tonnes until 2013 and corresponds to about 18% of the total estimated landing from capture fisheries in Brazil (about 760 thousand tonnes). The main species caught in the state across all years are sardines, herring, croaker and skipjack tuna (Figure 9). Historical records of the main species caught show a clear declining trend in catch of sardines, a key food fish regionally and in the country (Figure 9).

###### São Paulo

The state of São Paulo has a continuous data collection program dating back from 1998 (Figure 10-A). Although this state is not the main fisheries producer in the country, landing average about 35 thousand tonnes per year (about 5% of the total estimated landing from capture fisheries in Brazil). 2017 was the year in which data collection program covered all regions in the state, which explains increased catches during this period. The main species caught in the state across all years were shrimps, crayfish and crabs (Figure 10-B). The fishing fleet from this state is mainly artisanal, with very few industrial boats.

#### Aquaculture Production

According to the Brazilian fish farming association (PeixeBR), the aquaculture industry is the fastest growing food production sector in the country (PeixeBR, 2018). Brazil has some the largest potential for aquaculture in the world and will become a significant producer of fish in the next years. Fish farming has been growing around 8% per year in recent years, with a large increase in farming of native fish, especially in the north and middle-west regions. Additionally, Brazil is the fourth largest producer of tilapia in the world, with rapidly growing industries in the south and northeast regions. Another important aquaculture industry in the country is shrimp farming in the northeast region, although it has not been growing the production in recent years (Table 12). According to PeixeBR, there was a total production of about 690k tones of fish from aquaculture in 2017 (plus about 80k of shrimp, which totals about 771k tones). Thus, aquaculture products are already an important source of seafood for Brazil and has the perspective to grow rapidly in the future.


```{r Aquaculture_T, eval=T,echo=F}

data.frame(Species_group = c("Tilapia", "Native fish", "Shrimp", "Others"), 
           Production_tonnes = c(357639/1000, 302235/1000, 80000/1000, 31825/1000),

      col.names = c("Species group","Production\n(Thousand tones)","Percent\n(%)"),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
      )
```

#### Fish Trade 

Despite large potential for seafood production from both capture fisheries and aquaculture, Brazil imports large quantities of seafood for domestic consumption. In 2017, Brazil imported more than 380 thousand tonnes of fish and seafood products, while exporting less than 10% of that value (Figure 11). Local production is clearly insufficient for meeting national seafood demand, and fish stock recoveries and increased aquaculture production are required to support national food security. 



```{r B_Trade_G, eval = T, echo = F, warning =F, message = F, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Seafood and fish imports and exports from Brazil between 2014 to 2017 (Source: MDIC)"}

  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Trade Category"))

```


Fish and seafood import data shows that the main imported species in the last four years were salmon, followed by sardines, catfish (*Pangasius*) and hake (Table 13). There was a major increase in the import of sardines in the last two years, from 17 thousand tonnes imported in 2015 to 90 thousand tonnes in 2017. This increase is mainly result of the decline in sardine catches from the industrial fleet (Figure X above for Santa Catarina).

According to information from research developed about this fishery, about 100 thousand tonnes of sardine was landed in 2014 followed by a decline to about 20 thousand tonnes in 2017 (Pincinato and Asche 2018). According to the authors, this decline is mainly because of environmental variability in the south of Brazil and “El Niño” events that occurred during that period. Thus, Brazilian sardine and imports form a fully integrated market, which maintains a steady supply of sardines to canary industries year-round.

#### Fresh Water Fish in the Amazon

Fisheries production in Amazon state is exclusively from riverine systems and artisanal fisheries. According to estimates from the state government, production has remained stable over the last decade, totaling around 200 thousand tonnes per year (Figure 12). From the estimated production, about 40% of the catch is for subsistence of riverine communities.

### National Seafood Supply

Using data from FAO and quantity imported and exported, it is possible to estimate the amount of seafood that is consumed in Brazil per year. The estimated consumption of seafood in Brazil is based on 760 thousand tonnes from capture fisheries plus 750 thousand tonnes from aquaculture and 380 thousand tonnes from imports, minus 37 thousand tonnes for exports. This results in an estimated 1.86 million tonnes of seafood consumed in Brazil. Assuming equal consumption per capita for the total population of 200 million, this would suggest a yearly consumption of about 9.3 kg per capita.

**Top Fisheries by Domestic Consumption**

Domestic consumption of fish and seafood in Brazil is estimated to be around 10 kilograms per capita per year (@FAO2014). Per capita consumption in Brazil is low relative to other countries (average of 18 kg in the world) and the World Health Organization recommendation of 12 kg per capita. However, fish and seafood consumption has been steadily increasing from 4.6 kg per capita in 1961 to about 10 kg per capita in 2014 (FAO). Because of Brazil’s large population (about 200 million people), this sums up to large amounts of seafood being consumed in the country, although consumption significantly varies across regions of the country. Additionally, estimates from FAO do not account for subsistence consumption of fish, that in some regions of the Amazon can be as high as 169 kg/capita/year (@Isaacetal2015). According to estimates from the fisheries department of Amazon state, about 80 thousand tonnes of fish are caught for subsistence by riverine communities (Figure 12).

Data from CEAGESP market suggests that the main species consumed in Brazil in 2017 was sardine, followed by tilapia, croaker, salmon, sharks and weakfishes (Table xxx), supporting results from intergovernmental data analysis (see Table/Figure 14). Of these species, tilapia and salmon are produced through aquaculture and the remaining are from fisheries. In São Paulo market alone, 4.2 thousand tonnes of tilapia were traded, with a total for all fish and seafood products of 42 thousand tonnes in 2016 and 37 thousand  tonnes in 2017.

Data from SIGSIF shows that the main species processed in the country in 2017 was tilapia, followed by tambaqui or cachama (*Colossoma macropomum*), sardine, croaker, salmon, tambatinga (hybrid aquaculture species from the Amazon), catfish, and tuna (Table 15). From the top 10 species processed in the country, 5 are from aquaculture production and 5 are from wild caught fisheries. A total of 360k tonnes of fish and seafood products were commercialized by 472 processing and distribution companies. This volume corresponded to about 20% of all estimated seafood consumed in the country (1.8b tonnes).

Figure 13 shows the regional patterns of the data from seafood processing industries (SIGSIF). The map on the left (producers) shows the quantity of fish and seafood products that entered industries directly from producers (fisheries and aquaculture). This map provides insights on the main producing states and location of seafood industries. According to this map, the Rio de Janeiro state has the largest density of seafood industries in the country. The map on the right (commerce) shows the quantity of fish and seafood products received from other seafood industries. In other words, the map shows the exchange of products between seafood industries. Because the map shows the receiving sates, it provides important insights on the consumption of seafood products per region. It is important to highlight that Santa Catarina state shows high quantity of fish and seafood products received, but not necessarily means there is high consumption. This happens because Santa Catarina State is where most of the sardine and tuna canaries are located. Such canned products are produced in these states and then distributed and consumed all over the country.

Consumption of fish and seafood products in Brazil increases significantly during religious dates. Data from CEAGESP suggests that seafood consumption increases during Easter, when other types of meat are not consumed in respect of Catholic tradition. For this reason, there is a significant peak in fish and seafood consumption during Easter week (Figure 14).

Fish and seafood consumption in Brazil has distinct patterns according to the region of the country. As shown in IBGE data, the top consumers of fish and seafood products in the country are from the north and northeast regions (Figure 15-A). These regions are the poorest of the country (Figure 15-B) and have the greatest number of registered fishers [@MPA2013], especially from the small-scale sector. 

Since most of the artisanal production is consumed locally, these regions have greater availability of fish and seafood products relative to capitals far from fishing activities. In addition to greater availability of fish and seafood products, the North and Northeast regions of Brazil have, in general, greater tradition of consuming seafood products. Because of extensive areas of coastline, the northeast region has tradition of eating seafood in restaurants close to the ocean, especially in the summer. Similarly, the North region has extensive areas of rivers and coast, being part of the culture to eat fish and seafood products. In other parts of the country, people traditionally eat other types of protein. Brazil has historically been a agriculture and livestock production country, with large tradition of eating barbecue and bovine meat. In many places there are cultural barriers for regularly consuming fish and seafood products. However, with increased aquaculture production, many of these states are now producing more fish and as consequence are starting to eat more fish. In addition, people are increasingly aware of the health benefits derived from eating fish and seafood products. In summary, the north and northeast regions are the greatest consumers of fish and seafood in the country because of the availability and tradition of consuming fish and seafood products. Because these regions are the poorest of the country, fish and seafood products are crucial for food security, especially in coastal and riverine areas.

In the North and Northeast regions, where consumption of seafood is highest, it is important to distinguish resources that are important for food security in coastal and riverine areas. Generally, while the most valuable species are usually sold for profit, smaller and less valuable fish are consumed by fishers and their families. Hundreds of species are consumed in these regions, with very little information on the most important species for food security.

For those people not involved directly in fishing activity, consumption of fish and seafood products is expensive relative to other protein types (Figure 15-A). Fish and seafood products (R 32, \$US ~9) are on average three times more expensive than poultry (R 10, \$US ~3), twice the price of pig meat (R 15, \$US ~ 4) and 25% more expensive than cow meat (R 23.18, \$US ~6) [@InstituteofAgricultureEconomics-IEA2018]. Such difference in price ca explain in part the low consumption of fish and seafood products in Brazil, especially during an economic crisis. In many cases, consumption of fish and seafood products are mostly in restaurants as a "fancy" dinner and not a meat for the day-to-day life.

In addition to elevated prices, frozen seafood products available in supermarkets are many times unreliable and with poor quality. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, seafood fraud was detected in 21% of the fish sold in supermarkets. In addition, a preeminent newspaper article pointed out that 70% of frozen fillets sold in supermarkets had excess water, reaching up to one third of the total weight of the fish. This practice makes the product even more expensive and discourages people from buying seafood products [@FolhadeSP2008]. Therefore, for the average consumer, seafood products are expensive and unreliable relative to other protein options. This explains in part low seafood consumption levels in many parts of the country.

Data on the main species consumed in Brazil suggests that consumers are mostly driven by price, although there are some exceptions. From the top 10 seafood products sold in CEAGESP, 6 where below the 0.5 percentile of prices (Table 16). This indicates that the primary driver of domestic consumption is affordability. However, there are some expeditions, such as salmon, shark and shrimps. Consumption of these species are mainly driven by desirability, supplying high-end markets and restaurants. Species such as salmon and shrimp have high demand because of their distinct flavor and color. Other species, especially white fish can be more easily substituted by other similar fish.

The aquaculture industry in Brazil has been growing rapidly. In the North region, farmed fish is already affecting the market and reducing prices. Today, a large portion of the fish consumed in the region is produced by aquaculture. Tilapia is already the second most commercialized species in the CEAGESP market in São Paulo and the top species processed by seafood companies in the country. Cachuma (or Tambaqui) is a native species farmed in the north and mid-west regions and is the second most processed fish by seafood industries in Brazil. Therefore, with the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the country, the domestic supply of seafood will increase thus increasing accessibility of fish and seafood product for Brazil's population.

### National Economic Participation

Because there is no reliable national-level landings data in Brazil since 2008, it is challenging to determine the top fisheries by income generated in the country. Data available are mainly from the industrial sector, where sardines, croaker and tuna are the main species caught. However, information from the SIGSIF (Table 15) and Santa Catarina state landings does not have any information on price. 

A report by Nielsen analytic (Nielsen, 2018) shows that the canned sardine market in Brazil is valued at about 1.4 billion Brazilian Reais (approx. 380 million Dollars) and the canned tuna market is worth about 145 million Brazilian Reais (approx. 39 million Dollars). Additionally, according to the Brazilian seafood industry association, seafood industries have an aggregate revenue of 8 billion Brazilian Reais (approx. 2.2 billion Dollars) per year. These numbers demonstrate the strength of the seafood market (especially canned market) in Brazil and the importance of sardines for income and food security in the country.

Data from CEAGESP market have important information on the value of seafood in the country. This database contains quantity and price information for all seafood products. Products sold in the market are both from industrial and artisanal sectors. Table 17 shows the main species ranked by value sold in the CEAGESP market in 2017. The most valuable species in this year were sardines followed by sharks, croaker, tuna and acoupa weakfish (Table 17). 

Sharks are not distinguished by species and are captured by both artisanal and industrial fleets. Sardines, croakers and tunas are caught mainly by the industrial fleet, while the acoupa weakfish is mainly caught by artisanal fisheries from the north and northeast regions of Brazil. Snook is also one of the top 10 species sold in the market and mainly captured by the artisanal sector. It is one of the species with greater price in the market.

Many important small-scale resources are not sold in the CEAGESP market but are important sources of income through sale in local markets. Resources such as crabs, mullets, shrimp, snappers and groupers are very important sources of income for small-scale fishers. Only from our databases there are over 500 different species reported. For example, in São Paulo state most of the production is from small-scale fisheries sector. In this state, total fisheries value has increased in latest years, fluctuating at around one million reais per year (Figure 16-B). If we divide total value (1 million) by the number of registered fishers in the state (26k), there is an annual income of about 37k per fisher. In this state, shrimps, crab and crayfish are the most important species in terms of value (Table 16).

Another important piece of information regarding income generated are the main species exported in Brazil. Data from the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) show that the main species exported are lobsters, followed by other fish, swim bladders and pelagic fish (tunas and swordfish) (Table 19). The main species exported, lobsters, are caught exclusively by the artisanal sector, with resources threatened by over exploitation (according to the Ministry of Environment). Because of the high value, the lobster fishery is profitable even when the resource is depleted. Exports of lobsters in Brazil reached staggering US$ 73 million in 2017, with no reported landings of the species in the country.

#### Wild-caught Fish Employment

As pointed out in the introduction, Brazil has no reliable data on the number of fishers in the country. To respond this question we put together several pieces of information from different sources to have an estimate of the importance of fisheries for employment in Brazil. 

Data from IBGE (2013) estimated that Brazil had about 500 thousand fishers throughout the country, with 90% from the small-scale sector and 10% from the industrial sector [@CamposandChaves2016]. However, data from the extinct Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA) suggests there are many more fishers in Brazil (Figure 17). According to these data, there were about one million registered fishers in 2013 throughout the country, with about 95% of the registered fishers from the small-scale sector (MPA). There is a large discrepancy between these two sources, which reiterates the uncertainty around estimates of the number of fishers in the country. Nonetheless, these numbers highlight the huge importance of the fisheries sector to employment in Brazil. 

```{r Brazil_Registerd fishers, eval = T, echo = F, warning =F, message = F, fig.cap= "Number of registered fishers in Brazil from 2003 to 2010. Dataset Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture", fig.height=4,fig.width=6}

# rgp_MPA.csv
ggplot(Brasil_Data[[11]], 
       aes(x = year,
           y = fishers/1000)
       ) + 
  # geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           # fill = "#046C9A") +

       # caption = "Figure 1 - Number of registered fishers in Brazil from 2003 to 2010 (Source: Minitry of Fisheries and Aquaculture)"
       ) + 
  ggtheme_plot()

```

##### Artisanal sector

Assuming that the number of fishers are between 500 thousand and 1 million, and that about 90% of them are from the small-scale sector, the most important fisheries for employment in the country are those from the artisanal sector. The artisanal sector is where we have the least amount of data on the production and species harvested. There is an estimate from the MPA that 50-70% of the catch from the entire country comes from the artisanal sector (MPA, 2013). Small-scale fisheries in Brazil target hundreds of species and there is no reliable information on the most important species for this sector. 

Most of the registered fishers in Brazil are from the North (37% of total registered fishers) and Northeast regions (52% of total registered fishers) (Figure 18) [@MPA2013]. In these regions, freshwater resources from the Amazon and estuarine fisheries are very important. From the Amazonas state, the top commercialized fish are: curimatã (*Prochilodus nigricans*), jaraqui (*Semaprochilodus spp.*), matrinchã (*Brycon amazonicus*), pacu *(Mylossoma duriventre*), tambaqui (*Colossoma macropomum*) and tucunaré (*Cichla monoculus*) (data from the secretary of fisheries in the Amazon state - @Sepror, 2018). In estuaries, there are many important resources such as the mangrove crabs, shrimps, bivalves, weakfish and snook (information gathered though literature review and interviews). Besides these fisheries, the small-scale fishers target all ecosystems and resources, such as pelagic, reefs, demersal and coastal. In the Northeast region for example, reef fisheries are very important, capturing some highly valued species such as snappers, groupers and lobsters. In the south, the mullet fishery is very important, with the first quota system for Brazil implemented in 2018 to manage this fishery. Therefore, the artisanal sector is a multi-species fishery, with the main species depending on the region and ecosystem.

Employment along the supply chain varies according to the region, fisheries and species commercialized. In the artisanal sector, most of the catch is consumed regionally, or in nearby capitals. However, some valuable fish and seafood are also commercialized in the main capitals - São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. These fish are sold through middleman and larger seafood industries to large capitals, thus involving a larger number of people in the supply chain. However, there is no reliable estimate on the total number of people employed in the supply chain of artisanal fisheries. The MPA estimates that there are about two million people involved in these fisheries (MPA, 2013). 

##### Industrial sector

Industrial fisheries in Brazil employ only about 5% of the fishers and is responsible for about 30-50% of the fisheries production. The industrial sector in Brazil is mainly concentrated in the south of the country, especially in Santa Catarina state where the main industrial fisheries port is located (*Itajai port)*. Landings data from Santa Catarina state indicate that sardines are the most important species, followed by corvina and skipjack tuna (Table 20). Another important industrial fisheries fleet is located in the mouth of the Amazon river, in the north of Brazil. The main resource captured in the region is the catfish piramutaba (*Brachyplatystoma vaillantii*), although there is no data available from this fleet. Therefore, the top fisheries by employment in the industrial sector are represented in the landings data from the Santa Catarina state and the piramutaba fishery in the north.

In the industrial sector, the majority of the catch is processed by large companies to be distributed in supermarkets and restaurants all over the country. According to data published by the Seafood Industry Association (ABIPESCA), the seafood industry employs about 8 thousand direct employments and 30 thousand indirect employments. Data from the seafood companies (SIGSIF) indicates that the most important industrial fisheries are sardines, croacker, tuna and piramutaba catfish (Table 20). Thus, the industrial sector employs relatively less people per tonne of captured fish compared to the artisanal sector.

## Results Chile

### Fisheries Context

To evaluate the volume contribution of specific fisheries over the last five years, we used records of landings and aquaculture harvests from SERNAPESCA  (2013-2017). Using monthly data  published by IFOP, we identified the most exported fish products in terms of volume. To identify the participation of different species in exported volumes we generated a new database linking types of products listed in the *Arancel Aduanero* with the names of the fished and farmed species listed by SERNAPESCA. We searched for all the products ids that refer to the species scientific name, common name or genus name as listed by SERNAPESCA and aggregated them under the species name.

#### Wild Caught Fish

##### Main wild-caught fisheries in terms of volume 

According to landing records from SERNAPESCA over the last five years, the artisanal sector lands on average 1.6 ± 0.58 million annual tons of marine species while the industrial sector lands around 0.9 ± 0.16 million tons per year. Is worth noting that the artisanal sector includes landings of algae and Bentham species that are not targeted by the industrial sector. Both sectors have among their most landed species the Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) and the Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*) two species that are mostly used as inputs for fish meal and oil (Figure 19). Other important species in artisanal landings are the Giant grey kelp (*Lessonia nigrescens*), exported mostly as dried algae, and the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), mostly commercialized fresh or frozen for HC. The Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*) is also an important fishery in terms of volume for the industrial sector, which is also mostly use in the production of fish meal and oil and to a lesser extent use for direct HC smoked or canned.

Over the last years the catch composition of the artisanal sector has presented no major changes except from one species of algae (Giant brown kelp, *Lessonia trabeculata*) replacing other (Red algae gracilaria, *Gracilaria spp*) within the top 5 landed species as for 2013. In the case of the industrial sector, composition of the main three species seem to be stable over the last five years. Yet, the South pacific hake (*Merlucius gayi*) stooped being one of the species most fished by the industrial sector after 2013. This can be explained by the reduction of the total allowable catch for this species given its risk of collapse in those years (@subpesca_cuota_2013). After 2013, the industrial sector introduced the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) among its top 5 landed species. As for 2016 the Chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) has entered the top 5 for the industrial sector replacing Patagonian grenadier (*Macruronus magellanicus*). Other important species are the *mote sculpin* and different algae for the artisanal sector (Table 21).

##### Regional Diferences in volumes of wild-caught fisheries

Landed tons for 2017 shows that the amount of landings varies widely along the coast of Chile for both artisanal and industrial sectors. Figure 20 show the mean total landing per sector and region. The color of the bars represents the most landed species in 2017. We observe that the VIII region is by far the region with most landings from both sectors. However, the industrial sector also concentrate landings in the north of the country while artisanals are more spread. The most landed species in 2017 also varies by region but has changed little over the last five years (**Table App.3** and **Table App.4**).

#### Aquaculture production

##### Main farmed fisheries in terms of volume

The main species harvested from aquaculture centers in the last 5 years have been the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), Coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*), mussels (*Mytilus chilensis*) and the Red algae gracilaria (*Gracilaria spp.*) in descending order (Figure 21). Overall, the composition of the most farmed species and its volumes have been stable over the last 5 years. However, the Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) seems to be becoming less important over recent years.

##### Regional Diferences in farmed fisheries

Aquaculture production is highly concentrated in the South of the country, between the X and the XII regions (Figure 22). Nevertheless, from the I to the IV region the most farmed resources are algaes and scallops (*Argopecten purpuratus*) (**Table App.5**). The red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) became the most farmed in 2013 in the V region, replacing the Turbot (*Scophtalmus maximus*). Towards the south salmons and trouts are the most farmed species along with some algaes and mussels (*Mytilus chilensis*). The most farmed species in the austral south are the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) and the Chilean mussel (*Mytilus chilensis*).

#### Fish Trade
 
Around 72% of the landings from fisheries and aquaculture are exported outside the country (@ifop_monitoreo_2015). The main species exported is Atlantic salmon produced in aquaculture, followed by far by jack mackerel (Figure 23-A). Tuna leads the import activities followed, also by far, by jack mackerel (Figure 23-B)

### National Seafood Supply

Chile is considered one of the main countries in fishery production worldwide (@fao_estado_2016), however several reports and studies suggest the Chilean population does not consume as many marine products (@gonzales_solo_2018). On average, people consume 10-13 kg a year, compared to the 20 kg a year recommended by Food and Agriculture organization (2016). Looking into what type of seafood the Chilean population consumes, a study done in 2012 shows that 60% of the seafood consume are pelagic fishes, 12% are mollusk and 2% are crustaceans (@villena_marcelo_diagnostico_2012).

According to the National Health Survey (Encuata Nacional de Salud, ENS), only 9.2% of the Chilean population eats fish at least two times a week as recommended. This value has decreased since the early 2000s where this percentage was 10.7% (@ENS). World data (@ritchie_our_nodate) also shows a decrease in the amount of percapita seafood consumed by the Chilean population from ~16kg consumed in 2004 to 12.5kg in 2013.

The frequency of seafood consumption varies along socio-economic groups in Chile, according to a study done in 2016 by Fundación Chile and Adimark (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016), 55% of the high-income group consumes seafood at least once a week compared to the 38% of the lower-income group. It has also been identified (@ENE) that people with less years of schooling tend to eat less fish (only 6.3 percent eats seafood twice a week) than people that have completed high school education, where 11.2% eats as frequently. 

Within the Chilean population there is a strong belief that seafood is expensive. However, there is wide range of fish prices. There are expensive products such as salmon or lobsters and affordable alternatives such as Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo Flying Squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) and Southern Rays Bream (*Brama australis*) (@ENE).

#### Species contribution to Human and Non-human consumption

As a first approach to analyzed main fisheries that countribute to human conssumption in Chile, we looked into landings, aquaculture harvest and raw material that goes to processing facilities. Our results show that considering landing plus aquiculture harvest, the main species that enter supply chains of HC are the Atlantic Slamon (*Salmo salar*) and the Chilean Mussel (*Mytilus chilensis*), two of the main aquaculture products from Chile (Figure sp_HC_with_Aq). On the other hand species that are used for non-human consumptions are Peruvian Anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) Araucarian Herring (*Strangomera bentincki*), the two main wild-caught fisheries of the country (Figure Figure sp_HC_with_Aq). The contribution of each specie to human consumption and non human consumption is relativly stable through time.

```

Within the wild-cought species, the one that have historically contributed more to human consumption products are: Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and in a minor contribution Sea Urchins (*Loxechinus albus*) (Figure sp_HC_no_Aq). These results also shows that the amount of wild caught fiheries that go to non-human consumption is more than the double and some years the triple of what that goes to human consumption.


```{r figure species for HC, echo= FALSE, eval=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap= "Main species landed that are designated for human consumption"}
sp_HC_no_Aq
```

In Chile, almost all industrial landings ($L_i$) and aquaculture harvest ($Aq$) go to processing facilities while only some of the artisanal landing ($L_a$) is processed. We assume that the the artisanals' catch that is not sent to processing facilities is sold as non-processed products for human consumption ($NP_{HC}$). These approach allowed us to analyze main species sold by artisanal fisher and we assumed it is all for human consumption. Species vary across years, but the Southern rays bream (*Brama australis*) is the only specie that is common for every year of data (Figure NP_HC_plot). Indicating that historically has been an importat specie for direct human consumption. This aligns with results obtained in a survey implemented along Chile where 51% answered that Southern rays bream was their first preference (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016). Within 2013, 2014 and 2016, we can see the presence of anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), while in 2017 there is high increase in Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*). We identified that data per sector provided by SERNAPESCA for 2015  was not accurate therefore remeoved it for this analysis.

#### Main fisheries for food supply

To identify the main fisheries for human food supply in Chile we combined datasets from landings, aquaculture, raw material that goes into facilities for non-human consumption, imports and exports. Assuming that all local landings and harvest that is not processed as non-human consumption products or exported is comsumed locally. Eventhough landings and aquaculture databases are detailed at a species level, we agragated the data in larger groups (See appendix) to be able to combine them with the Chilean Customs datasets. Our results show, that the main fishery for local consumption across the years has been squid. Within this group we considered: Patagonian squid (*Loligo gahi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), Argentine shortfin squid (*Illex argentinus*) and Japanese flying squid (*Todarodes Pacificus*). These species predominate local consumption from 2013 to 2017, however, we found that in 2017 there was an increase in the exports of this group of species, therefore explaining their relatively less contribution to domestic consumption. Other local fisheries important for domestic human consumption in Chile are Hakes (Southern hake *Merluccius australis*, South Pacific hake *Merluccius gayi gayi*, Patagonian grenadier *Macruronus magellanicus*, Southern blue whiting *Micromesistius australis*) and Southern rays bream (*Brama australis*) (Figure top5_hc_fig_Lan). It is important to mention that the Southern rays bream is classified on its own group, therefore its relative contribution to domestic consumption is higher compered to other aggregated groups. Another caviet to make here is that squids have a the highest yield of all species, therfore there contribution to domestic consumption per landed ton is higher, partly explining its high predominance in our results.  

Our models show the chilean population also consumes high volumens of Tuna, however this is mainly imported in a canned format. This results aliged with the chilean population preferences, based on a study along the country, where 84% of the respondee aswered that their normal format for eating fish within a month was canned fish, follwed by freshed fish (80%) and frozen fish (37%) (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016). The ten most importat fisheries according to our model are shown in table XX.

#### Total and per capita food consumption in the country
Our models is highly sensitive to species yield, therefore not in many cases results of our calculations return a negative number implaying that exports are higher than the product of the yield times the local production (landings nad aquaculture) minus all tons that go for non-human consumption products. Assuming that all negative numbers do not contribut to domestic consumption (all of the product is exported and non is imported), we calculated a percapita consumption per year. 
We summed all the human consumption per year (Table XX) and devided by the chilean population of 17,762,681 (@INE, 2015). Results aling with what has been calculated in by others studies with an average of 11.5 kg of seafood compsumption a year, which is similar to what has been estimated by the FAO (2016) for Chile of 10-13kg of fish a year.

```{r eval=F}
##Percapita consumption table

##FALTA TABLA!!!
```



#### Regional differences in per capita and total consumption
We where not able to do a regional analysis. Even though most of the data is provided at a regional level. We realized that is was not possible to assume that what was landed in a region was processed in that same area. According to a study done along the Chilean coast, 62% of the population from the north declares to eat fish once a week. in the north centre region that numbers decreases to 54% and it reaches its lowest point in the Metropolitan Region (42%). In the center south, 48% each fish at least once a week while in the south 48% (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016)

### National Economic Participation

Fisheries, as an economic sector in Chile, considers activities of extraction and farming of marine and freshwater products. This sector contributes to around 0.4% of the national GDP although it is a highly variable sector (@central_cuentas_2017). An estimate of 2014, indicates that 90% of the sales of the sector came from farmed products (@sence_reporte_2015). What reflects the relevance of aquaculture in economic terms relative to wild fisheries. Yet, the extractive sector has a higher number of firms, 58% of the total (@sence_reporte_2015). Fishing manufacturing is closely relates to fisheries. Based on the last input-output matrix for the country's economy, for every 100 US dollars spent in the fisheries sector, another 52.2 dollars are generated in the manufacturing sector. Other sectors affected by fisheries are the financing sector (24.8 dollars generated every 100) and transportation and communication (13.4 dollars generated every 100). 

#### Wild-caught Fish Economic Participation

The contribution of fisheries to regional GDP suggests that the economic importance of the sector to regional economies varies widely. Ranging from almost 30% in the XI region to 0% in the metropolitan (RM) and IX region (Figure 23).  

```{r Fisheries_PIB_Chile_G, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap= 'Percent of the regional GDP contirbuted by the fisheries sector averaging data between 2013 and 2016. Data source: Banco Central de Chile.'}

```

Based on our estimates of species-specific revenue the most important species for the artisanal sector are the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*) (Figure 23). Nonetheless, this varies across years. In 2017 the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) and the Southern rays bream or Corvina (*Brama australis*) were the species that provided more revenue followed by the Pink cusk-eel (*Genypterus blacodes*) in the artisanal sector.

Some of these species are among the most expensive (*Table App.6*). The Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) has the highest mean ex-vessel price in the artisanal sector what explains in part why is one of the top 5 in term of revenues. We should notice that the fishing costs for different types of species could vary widely and we are not accounting for this in our analysis. Yet, we can qualitatively consider the costs of different types of fishing. For example, some of these species are fished by diving near the shore like the Chilean abalone (*Concholepas concholepas*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*) while others like the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*), the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) or the Swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*) involve offshore fishing, which tends to be much more expensive. The gathering of algae from the shore is arguably one of the less costly extractive activities for the artisanal sector but it is not among the ones that generate more revenue. We could not generate similar estimates for the industrial and aquaculture subsectors due to lack of data.

#### Trade Economic Participation

Seafood products are one of the most important exports of the country. IFOP valued the exportation of fisheries-related products in $6,280 million dollars in 2017 (@ifop_boletines_2017). This corresponded to ~ 9 % of the total value of national exportation. The most important exported species are the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), the Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) and the Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*)(*Figure 6*). All three produced via aquaculture. Mussels, specifically the Chilean Ribbed Mussel (*Aulacomya ater*) and the Chorus mussels (*Choromytilus chorus*) are also among the most valuable exports. These are landed by artisanal fishers and to a lesser extent produced in aquaculture centers. 

The most valuable sea products in terms of exports are frozen and fresh followed by fish meal and dried algae (@ifop_boletines_2017). In 2016, fish fillets were the fourth most exported product by Chile. This commodity generates around 2 billion US dollar per year and is mainly made of farmed salmon (@datachile_fish_2016).

#### Fish and Aquaculture Employment

Fisheries and aquaculture are considered to be the activities that provide less direct employment in the country after agriculture (@sense_reporte_2015). Yet, the number of people employed in the sector has been on the rise since 2010 (@sence_reporte_2015). We estimated a total of ~ 278,000 job positions generated by fisheries and aquaculture. This estimate considers artisanal and industrial fishers, workers in processing facilities and aquaculture centers and indirect jobs generated by the manufacturing sector (*Table 2*). It does not include other indirect jobs generated by the extractive activities and its commercialization. Thus, the number of total people directly and indirectly employed by fisheries and aquaculture in Chile could be higher. 

```{r Employment_Chile_T, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}

kable_styling(latex_options = 'hold_position') %>% 
  column_spec(4, width = "6cm") #%>% #wraps text in column2

```

People employed in the fisheries and aquaculture activities have an average monthly income of 579 US dollars, the lowest mean income in the country after the one generated by the agricultural sector (@sence_reporte_2015). This value ranges from 258 US dollars for people working independently and part-time to 1,160 US dollars for full-time employers (*Table App. 7*).

On average, people employed in the fisheries and aquaculture sector are a younger and less educated relative to the national average and are mostly men (*Table App. 8*). However, there is high variation within subsectors, for example, artisanal fishers tend to be older @tam_gone_2018. Based on estimates from the New national survey of employment (NENE, 2015) only 57.7% of the people employed in the sector is formally employed by an employer, the rest work independently (@sense_reporte_2015).

#### Employment in the Artisanal Sector

The artisanal sector corresponds to fishing activities performed by vessels equal to or smaller than 18 meters in length and by collectors in the inter-tidal zone (@subpesca_panorama_2018). Based on the current RPA, there are around 89,000 artisanal fishers along with 12,700 vessels in Chile. *Figure X-A*, shows the number of artisanal fishers per region and gender. They are concentrated in the X and VIII regions and are mostly men. The main activity in the artisanal sector is harvester or collector, this mostly corresponds to algae collection on the shore. All regions present similar composition of fishing activities (*Figure X-B*). However, the X region seems to rely more on benthic resources for employment than the others since they have a greater share of divers and algae collectors.

#### Employment in the Industrial Sector

The industrial sector comprises activities performed by vessels larger than 18 meters. Currently, there are 475 industrial vessels and 164 vessel owners according to national industrial records (RPI), from which only 25 are individual owners and the rest are firms (@maturana_mujeres_2017). Besides, 3,500 jobs are generated through vessels operations (@subpesca_pesca_2018). We could only find information on the distribution of vessels (*Figure 8*). We observe that most industrial  extractive activities occur in the VIII region, as suggested by landings estimates discussed above. Still, vessels are registered along the entire coast. Some of the firms that own industrial vessels also own processing facilities whose employees are considered as part of the manufacturing stage.

#### Employment in the Industry

A rigorous study by IFOP estimated a total of ~50,000 job positions in the manufacturing of marine products in processing facilities in 2014 (@ifop_monitoring_2015). However, a more recent report form SERNAPESCA reports a total of 65,451 jobs (@maturana_mujeres_2017). *Figure 9* displays the geographic distribution of people employed in the manufacturing sector per gender and type of product for 2015. Employment in the processing facilities is dominated by human consumption (HC) products, with ~ 40,000 job positions. Products for animal consumption (AC) generated around 5,000 positions while algae products employed less than 3,000 people. Most people employed by the manufacturing sector are located in the southern part of the country and the majority are men.

#### Employment in the Aquaculture Sector

There are 17,631 people employed among the 3,683 aquaculture centers currently registered in Chile (@maturana_mujeres_2017). From these, ~4,500 are women. *Figure 10* shows the distribution of aquaculture centers per region and type of farmed species. The main type of product being farmed is fish, mostly salmon, followed by mollusks and algae. The X region hosts more than half of the aquaculture centers in the country.

## Results Peru

### Fisheries Context

Based on the most recent published data by the Ministry of Production, seven species and three groups of species (i.e. shrimps, tunas and sharks) were responsible for 95% of the country’s marine capture production (MCP) between 2010 and 2016 (Figure x) [@PRODUCE 2017]. Anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) represented 78% of these landings. On average, 3.93 (± 1.56) million tonnes this species were annually reduced into fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) during the studied period. Peruvian FMFO is mainly used in feed producing value chains abroad [@Christensen et al. 2014; @Majluf et al. 2016].

Only 22% of the Peruvian MCP was used in direct human consumption (DHC) value chains (Figure x), at a rate of 1.13 (± 0.13) million tonnes per year. Leading species for DHC include: Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Pacific chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) and Common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*). The remaining MCP (2%) is discarded at sea, never reaching Peruvian landing sites.

```

Although most MCP is caught by large-scale fishing vessels using industrial purse seine nets (i.e., used for targeting anchoveta). Nonetheless, MCP for DHC is mainly caught by small-scale fishing vessels, using multiple fishing methods and gears. Mackerel species, for example, are caught using artisanal purse seine nets, common dolphinfish is caught using small-scale longlines and the jumbo flying squid is caught using manual jigs [@SueiroDeLaPuente 2015].

```

Freshwater capture production (FAP) in Peru is severely underestimated by PRODUCE and has very low species resolution [@SueiroDelaPuente2015]. In the last published annual report, PRODUCE failed to segregate landings by species coming from freshwater systems [@PRODUCE2017]. As FAP is predominantly used for subsistence in rural Amazonian and Andean communities, the catch hardly ever reaches landing sites monitored by the regional fisheries authorities and thus is almost never registered [@SueiroDelaPuente2015]. Between 2010 and 2016 Peruvian freshwater systems produced average estimated yields of 68.30 (± 10.11) thousand tonnes per year. The reported freshwater capture production by PRODUCE during the study period totaled 478 thousand tonnes [@PRODUCE2017], amounting to ~1% of the marine capture production (**S_Table X**).

#### Aquaculture

Marine aquaculture production (MAP) in Peru is much smaller than its MCP. MAP is mainly focused on two species: the Peruvian calico scallop (*Argopecten purpuratus*) and the White-leg shrimp (*Litopenaeus vannamei*). Scallop aquaculture is a semi-intensive to extensive industry with annual average yields of 42,913 ± 19,804 tonnes per year. Only a minor segment of the producing entities purchases seeds from hatcheries and uses suspended cultures [@Mendoetal.2016; @Lopezdelalamaet al2018a]. Most scallop aquaculture production is harvested from bottom cultures in the Sechura Bay (*Piura* Region) using seeds taken from natural banks at *Isla Lobos de Tierra*, a marine protected area [@Lopezdelalamaetal.2018a]. Production is thus highly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions, where El Niño events have led to massive economic losses for producers along the Peruvian coast [@Badjeck et al. 2009; @Mendo et al. 2016].

Shrimp aquaculture has been increasing steadily during the study period, with an average annual production of 18,538 ± 3,045 tonnes per year. This is an intensive industry that uses closed-system cultures [@Christensen et al. 2014] in large pools near mangrove forest in northern Peru [@PRODUCE 2017]. Additionally, some artisanal fishing communities are starting exploratory cultures of red algae (*Chondracanthus chamissoi*). Their production however has not surpassed 150 tonnes per year and has been declining severely since it started in 2012. Similarly, a company is developing closed-system cultures of fine flounder (*Paralichthys adspersus*) and turbot (*Scophthalmus maximus*). Nonetheless, their production is still negligible for commercial purposes or national food security (3.05 ± 1.26 tonnes per year between 2012-2016).

It is worth noting that freshwater aquaculture production (FAP) has increased during the studied period surpassing marine aquaculture production in both 2015. FAP is based on rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) grown in Andean lakes and tilapia (*Oreochromis* sp.) grown in across the Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru. Both of these are introduced species. FAP of local species like gamitana (*Colossoma macropomum*) and arapaima (*Arapaima gigas*), has also increased during the studied period but remains small in comparison (**Fig x**).

#### Trade

Peru is both a major importer and exporter of seafood products. Based on data obtained from SUNAT, between 2010 and 2016, Peru imported 727.86 thousand tonnes of seafood products, at a rate of 103.98 ± 24.62 thousand tonnes per year **(Table 6)**. Peruvian seafood exports however are much larger than their imports. During the same period, Peru exported 10.76 million tonnes of seafood products, at a rate of 1.54 ± 0.39 million tonnes per year **(Table 6)**. When only focusing on products for DHC (i.e., excluding products for the aquarium trade, fishmeal and fish oil), average exports ascend to 371.56 ± 57.93 thousand tonnes per year, whilst imports to 97.24 ± 57.93 thousand tonnes per year.

```

It is worth noting that imports of Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) and basa (*Pangasius bocourti*), species which are not caught or cultivated in Peru, have recently increased. Between 2010-2016, net exports (i.e. exports minus imports) of basa were negative, occurring at an average rate of -2.18 ± 0.76 thousand tonnes per year. In the case of Atlantic salmon, a similar trend is seen. Net exports are negative and occurring at a rate of -1.72 ± 1.38 thousand tonnes per year. 

Tilapia (*Oreochromis* sp.), a non-native species that is farmed in Peru, shows a similar trend where net exports negative and decreasing (-1.46 ± 0.83 thousand tonnes per year). Conversely, net exports of rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*), a heavily farmed introduced species, are positive, increasing and occurring at an annual average rate of 1.03 ± 0.33 thousand tonnes per year. It is worth noting that aside of these species (Atlantic salmon, basa, rainbow trout and tilapia), almost all remaining trade for DHC involves marine species native to Peru.

Total net seafood exports of Peruvian products were positive between 2010-2016, occurring at an average rate of 327.65 ± 95.18 thousand tonnes per year. Interannual variability was mainly driven by changes in frozen jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) exports (**Figure X**).

However, trade data reveals that the Peruvian seafood market was unsatisfied by the local production during this period. This claim can be warranted by the decreasing trends in canned and fresh seafood net exports observed across time (**Table X**), and by the clear difference between species that showed positive and negative net exports. 

Peruvian products containing jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), macroalgae, anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), shrimps, Peruvian calico scallop (*Argopecten purpuratus*), Peruvian hake (*Merluccius gayi peruanus*) and common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*) were mainly destined for foreign market. Conversely, products made out of tunas (*Thunnus* sp.), skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*), Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) and sharks (*Selachimorpha*) were mainly imported by Peruvian companies working on seafood processing and retail.

### Estimating National Seafood Supply

When destined for direct human consumption (DHC) marine living resources landed (or harvested) in Peru enter one of four different supply chains these begin: frozen, fresh (refrigerated or chilled), canned, or cured [Christensen et al. 2014]. Before estimating the national food supply, we were able to estimate the ratio in which fresh fish (landed) is converted to actual consumable seafood (e.g. un tonne of fish could be 400 kg of actual edible meat) by supply chain.

```{r P_Frozen_seafood_G, eval=T, echo=F, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}

#### Frozen seafood

Based on PRODUCE data, 53% these resources were used as inputs in frozen seafood value chains during the studied period, at an average rate of 623.24 ± 105.60 thousand tonnes per year with 6 species responsible for 91% of the total frozen seafood production (**S_Table x**). With an average input-output ratio of 1:0.52, these inputs generated 325.24 ± 57.98 thousand tonnes of frozen seafood products per year. Frozen seafood production manifested an increasing trend until 2014 (inputs: 741.68 thousand tonnes | outputs: 379.73 thousand tonnes). However, it has decreased continuously since. The lowest frozen seafood production during the 2010-2016 period was recorded in 2016 (inputs: 466.71 thousand tonnes | outputs: 270.95 thousand tonnes).

<!-- - Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) accounted for 67% of the total frozen seafood production (total production: 1.51 million tonnes | average production: 216.38 ± 45.09 thousand tonnes per year). -->
<!-- Fluctuations in its production were responsible for the overall trends observed in this line of production. The largest frozen jumbo flying squid production was recorded in 2014 (276.53 thousand tonnes). -->

<!-- Production was highest in 2013 (15.79 thousand tonnes) and has been decreasing since. However, the lowest frozen hake production was recorded in 2012 (8.55 thousand tonnes). -->

#### Fresh (refrigerated or chilled) seafood

Inputs for this line of production account for 29% of the marine capture and aquaculture production destined for DHC. Fresh seafood wholesale has been increasing steadily during the study period, using on average 339.77 ± 48.19 thousand tonnes of fresh marine living resources per year as inputs. With an average input-output ratio of 1:0.55, these inputs generated 185.85 ± 30.63 thousand tonnes of fresh seafood products per year. There is a higher diversity of species found in fresh seafood products (e.g., fillets) in comparison to frozen seafood products, probably because: (*i*) this line of production requires less technological inputs, has fewer sanitary restrictions and oversight, and (*ii*) Peruvians have a strong preference for fresh seafood consumption [@Higuchi et al. 2017] – as has also been reported elsewhere in the world [@Carlucci et al. 2015]. Hence, eighteen species and five groups of species were responsible for 90% of the total Peruvian fresh seafood production (**S_Table x**).

<!-- •	Jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) accounted for 20% of the total fresh seafood production (total production: 260.45 thousand tonnes | average production: 37.21 ± 14.06 thousand tonnes per year). Fresh jumbo flying squid production shows an overall increasing trend, although the highest production was recorded in 2013 (65.64 thousand tonnes) and the lowest in 2011 (22.99 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) amounted to 14% of the total fresh seafood production (total production: 177.60 thousand tonnes | average production: 25.37 ± 18.87 thousand tonnes per year).

<!-- •	Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus) amounted to 6% of the total fresh seafood production (total production: 78.84 thousand tonnes | average production: 11.26 ± 5.84 thousand tonnes per year). Production shows an overall increasing trend. Highest fresh hake production was recorded in 2016 (20.43 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) amounted to 4% of the total fresh seafood production (total production: 54.01 thousand tonnes | average production: 7.72 ± 4.61 thousand tonnes per year). Fresh chub mackerel production shows an overall increasing trend reaching its peak in 2016 (15.69 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Sharks (Selachimorpha) also amounted to 4% of the total fresh seafood production (total production: 46.39 thousand tonnes | average production: 6.63 ± 1.79 thousand tonnes per year). The main contributors to fresh shark meat production are the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) [De la Puente 2017]. Fresh shark production has been increasing steadily since 2013, reaching its peak in 2016 (9.14 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) also amounted to 4% of the total fresh seafood production (total production: 46.30 thousand tonnes | average production: 6.61 ± 1.24 thousand tonnes per year). Production was highest in 2012 (8.58 thousand tonnes) but shows an overall increasing trend during the studied period. -->

#### Canned seafood

Canneries used 12% of the marine capture and aquaculture production destined for DHC between 2010-2016 as inputs, at an average rate of 138.75 ± 31.49 thousand tonnes per year. With an average input-output ratio of 1:0.54, the canning industry produced on average 74.50 ± 23.95 thousand tonnes of canned products (net weight – i.e., seafood in can) per year. Three species and one group of species (i.e., tunas) were responsible for 92% of the total production **(S_Table 5)**.

<!-- •	Anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) amounted to 50% of the total canned seafood production (total production: 258.78 thousand tonnes | average production: 36.97 ± 13.52 thousand tonnes per year). However, canned anchoveta production shows an overall decreasing trend, with highest production recorded in 2010 (54.70 thousand tonnes) and lowest in 2014 (21.63 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) amounted to 17% of the total canned seafood production (total production: 90.84 thousand tonnes | average production: 12.98 ± 19.34 thousand tonnes per year). Canned jack mackerel production has been highly variable but shows an overall decreasing trend. Highest production was recorded in 2011 (53.32 thousand tonnes) and its lowest in 2016 (242 thousand tonnes).  -->
<!-- •	Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) amounted to 16% of the total canned seafood production (total production: 84.60 thousand tonnes | average production: 12.09 ± 7.94 thousand tonnes per year). Canned chub mackerel production shows an overall increasing trend reaching its peak in 2016 (15.69 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Tunas (Thunnus sp.) amounted to 16% of the total canned seafood production (total production: 43.66 thousand tonnes | average production: 6.24 ± 2.70 thousand tonnes per year). Canned tuna production has fluctuated during the studied period but shows and overall increasing trend, with production peaking in 2015 (8.9 thousand tonnes).  -->

#### Cured seafood

The remaining 7% of the marine capture and aquaculture production destined to DHC is cured (i.e., salted and/or sun dried). Between 2010-2016, curing used a total of 595.52 thousand tonnes as inputs for production. With an average input-output ratio of 1:0.43, the curing industry produced on average 36.22 ± 4.11 thousand tonnes of cured products per year. Highest production was recorded in 2014 (43.37 thousand tonnes). Cured production is dominated by two species and one group of species (i.e., macroalgae), which account to 94% of the total production:


<!-- •	Macroalgae were responsible for 72% of the total cured seafood production (total production: 181.98 thousand tonnes | average production: 26.00 ± 3.36 thousand tonnes per year). Production was highest in 2013 (30.58 thousand tonnes) and has steadily decreased since. The lowest production was recorded in 2016 (21.80 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) amounted to 19% of the total cured seafood production (total production: 49.12 thousand tonnes | average production: 7.02 ± 2.14 thousand tonnes per year). Cured anchoveta production has been somewhat stable reaching its peak in 2014 (11.09 thousand tonnes). -->
<!-- •	Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) amounted to 3% of the total canned seafood production (total production: 8.36 thousand tonnes | average production: 1.19 ± 0.11 thousand tonnes per year). Cured chub mackerel production has been very stable reaching its peak in 2015 (1.28 thousand tonnes). Nonetheless, lowest production was recorded the following year (2016, 0.95 thousand tonnes). -->





#### Total and per capita seafood consumption

Due to the vast amount of data on Peruvian seafood we were able to estimate seafood consumption in three different ways. The first (*Decleared seafood consumption*) was using data from the Peruvian household survey (ENAHO) performed by INEI. Survey results include per capita seafood consumption estimates per region and species. We then estimated the total seafood consumption (in tonnes) by multiplying the national per capita consumption by the Peruvian population. Annual population estimates for Peru were downloaded from World Bank Open Data[^7]. As these indicators were constructed based on survey responses that are not field verified, we referred to them throughout the text as the total and per capita Declared Seafood Consumption (DSCT and DSCpc, respectively). 

The second approach to estimate seafood consumption was conducted using the method described in see section *Estimating National Seafood Supply* of this report. The Net Seafood Supply (NSS) was also divided by the Peruvian population. The resulting per capita National Seafood Supply (NSSpc) is comparable with DCSpc. 

[^7]: World Bank Open Data. Available at <https://data.worldbank.org>

Finally, the third approach includes using all available data obtained from PRODUCE and SUNAT to estimate the total and per capita apparent seafood consumption (ASCT and ASCpc, respectively). This method is similar to the previous as well as that which appears in Smith et al. (2010)[@Smith]. The main difference between the methods is that this one does not keep the assumption that all aquaculture production and international traded goods (i.e., imports and exports) are fully consumable. This is particularly relevant given that SUNAT registers the weight of shipments of seafood products leaving and entering Peru, but not the actual weight of seafood within them. 

Thus, building upon the work conducted by Christensen et al. (2014), we used a mass-balance approach and product-specific multipliers to estimate the amount of seafood within different locally and internationally traded products (e.g., the weight of seafood within a can), then estimated the net seafood supply for each line of production independently and added them together with the seafood remaining in country to estimate the ASCT.
In synthesis, the three methods produce different estimates of seafood consumption. The resulting indicators for total (i.e., DSCT, NSS and ASCT) and per capita (DSCpc, NSSpc and ASCpc) seafood consumption are comparable amongst each other. 

#####	Declared seafood consumption (DSC)

According ENAHO, per capita consumption of aquatic resources in Peru increased by 52%, going from 10.201 kg/person in 2010 to 15.50 kg/person in 2016 (**S_Table 8**). Within the same time frame, the contribution of seafood to this indicator increased from 77% in 2010 to 80% in 2016. Per capita declared consumption of seafood (DSCpc) of Peruvians in 2016 ascended to 12.36 kg/person. When segregated by product types, most seafood was consumed in fresh presentations (85%), followed by canned products (13%). Only a minor segment of seafood was consumed in cured presentations (1%), and no consumption was reported to come from frozen seafood products. 

Between 2010 and 2016 period, the total declared seafood consumption (DSCT) showed a 70% increase – growing much faster than DSCpc. In 2016 DSCT reached its highest value: 392.63 thousand tonnes. Sixteen species (and groups of species) were responsible for 90% of the DSCT during the 2010-2016 period (**S_Table 9**). 




<!-- These include: Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi | 30% DSCT), Eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis | 16% DSCT), tunas (Thunnus sp. | 12% DSCT), chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus | 10% DSCT), Peruvian weakfish (Cynoscion analis | 3% DSCT), Chilean silverside (Odontesthes regia | 3% DSCT), Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus | 2% DSCT), mussels (Aulacomya ater and Choromytilus chorus | 2% DSCT), lorna drum (Sciaena deliciosa | 2% DSCT), Sharks (2% DSCT), anchoveta (Engraulis ringens | 2% DSCT), common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus | 1% DSCT), flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus | 1% DSCT), crabs (1% DSCT), Peruvian rock seabass (Paralabrax humeralis | 1% DSCT), and Peruvian banded croaker (Paralonchurus peruanus | 1% DSCT). -->

When displayed by region DSCT revealed that 84% of seafood was consumed in the coastal regions of Peru (**Figure 3**). Lima was the largest market during the studied period concentrating 41% of the DSCT (**Table 10**). Other important markets were the *Piura*, *Lambayeque* and *La Libertad* regions, which respectively concentrated 11%, 8% and 6% of the DSCT. Additionally, the regional analysis of the DSCpc, revealed that seafood was more consumed per Peruvian in northern coastal regions (**Table 10**). These include *Lambayeque* (25.65 kg/person in 2016), *Tumbes* (24.43 kg/person in 2016) and *Piura* (23.76 kg/person in 2016). DSCpc in the *Ica*, *Callao* and *Lima* regions were also well above the national average. Conversely, DSCpc was lowest in the Peruvian Amazon, including the *Loreto* (1.66 kg/person in 2016), *Ucayali* (3.45 kg/person in 2016), *Madre de Dios* (4.20 kg/person in 2016), Amazonas (4.92 kg/person in 2016) and *San Martin* (5.33 kg/person in 2016) regions.

##### Net seafood supply (NSS)

With the exception of a decrease registered between 2011 (298.56 thousand tonnes) and 2012 (231.73 thousand tonnes), net seafood supply (NSS) increased continuously during the studied period. NSS increased 48% between 2012 and 2016, reaching a supply of 343.05 thousand tonnes. The estimated NSSpc also increased since 2012, but only by 40%. The highest estimated NSSpc was in 2016 with 10.80 kg/person. Fourteen species and/or groups of species were responsible for 90% of the Peruvian NSS (**S_Table 11**). 

<!-- These include: Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi | 24% of NSS), Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus | 15% of NSS), anchoveta (Engraulis ringens | 12% of NSS), Eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis | 10% of NSS), tunas (Thunnus sp. | 7% of NSS), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis | 5% of NSS), Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus | 4% of NSS), common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus | 4% of NSS), flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus | 3% of NSS), sharks (2% of NSS), Pacific harvestfish (Peprilus medius | 2% of NSS), lorna drum (Sciaena deliciosa | 1% of NSS), Peruvian weakfish (Cynoscion analis | 1% of NSS), Chilean silverside (Odontesthes regia | 1% of NSS). -->


##### Apparent seafood consumption (ASCT)

Total apparent seafood consumption (ASCT) showed an overall increasing trend during the studied period, as did the per capita apparent seafood consumption (ASCpc). ASCT showed a 32% increase between 2010 and 2016, whilst ASCpc increased by 22%. Both indicators showed high values in 2011, 2013 and 2016, peaking in 2016 (ASCT = 388.19 thousand tonnes | ASCpc = 12.22 kg/person). Most seafood (58%) was consumed fresh between 2010-2016 (**Table 12**). Fresh seafood was followed by canned products (20%) and frozen products (20%). Cured seafood consumption was minor (2%). Eighteen species and/or groups of species were responsible for 90% of the ASCT (**S_Table 13**). 

<!-- These were: Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi | 18% ASCT), chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus | 11% ASCT), jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas | 11% ASCT), anchoveta (Engraulis ringens | 11% ASCT), Eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis | 8% ASCT), common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus | 5% ASCT), tunas (Thunnus sp. | 5% ASCT), Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus | 4% ASCT), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis | 3% ASCT), sharks (3% ASCT), flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus | 2% ASCT), shrimps (2% ASCT), Pacific harvestfish (Peprilus medius | 1% ASCT), lorna drum (Sciaena deliciosa | 1% ASCT), Chilean silverside (Odontesthes regia | 1% ASCT), Peruvian weakfish (Cynoscion analis | 1% ASCT), flying fish (1% ASCT), and Patagonian squid (Doryteuthis gahi | 1% ASCT). -->


##### Comparing seafood consumption trends between the three approaches

Regardless of the method of estimation, seafood consumption in Peru is on the rise. The increase is strongest, steadiest and fastest in DSCpc (**Figure 4)**, as both ASCpc and NSSpc show a decrease in seafood consumption during 2012, which is not observed in DSCpc.


```{r P_Consumption_I, fig.width=4, fig.height=3,echo=FALSE, fig.align="center",fig.cap="Peruvian seafood consumption between all approaches"}

img <- readPNG("Report_Figures/Peru/Peru_Consumption.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```

<!-- ![](Report_Figures/Peru_Consumption.png) -->

<!-- Trends in ASCpc and NSSpc are very similar in trajectory, however the latter has statistically significant lower values than the former (Dunn test, p = 0.007). It is worth noting that no significant statistical differences were found between DSCpc and NSSpc (Dunn test, p = 0.151), nor between DSCpc and ASCpc (Dunn test, p = 0.078). Additionally, towards the end of the time series, estimated per capita seafood consumption through DSCpc and ASCpc grew much closer together (average difference between the two indicators of 0.4% during 2015-2016). -->

<!-- Regardless of the indicator, total seafood consumed in Peru between 2014-2016 was higher than 312 thousand tonnes per year, with ASCT and DSCT having average values above 360 thousand tonnes per year. -->

Six species, regardless of the indicator used, were consistently among the mayor contributors to national food security. These were (listed in decreasing order of importance): Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*), Eastern Pacific bonito (*Sarda chiliensis*), anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), tunas (*Thunnus* sp.) and Peruvian hake (*Merluccius gayi peruanus*). Additionally, Peruvian weakfish (*Cynoscion analis*), Chilean silverside (*Odontesthes regia*) and lorna drum (*Sciaena deliciosa*) appear to be much more important in the DSCT and DSCpc than in any other indicator. Whilst species like flying jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) and the common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*), appear to be much more important in ASCT and ASCpc than in other indicators (**Fig x**).

### Estimating National Economic Participation

The Peruvian fisheries sector has been shown to have an almost constant economic multiplier across time. Both Dyck and Sumaila (2010) [@Dyck], using 2003 data, and Christensen et al. (2014), using 2009 data, found that the fisheries sector had an average income multiplier of 2.9. This entails that every time USD 1.0 is made at sea (i.e., catching fish), activities on land (i.e., processing, distribution, wholesale and retail) additionally produce USD 1.9. Christensen et al. (2014) also found that employment behaved in a similar way, also showcasing a multiplier of 2.9.

Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that general multipliers for the Peruvian fisheries sector are severely skewed by the fish meal and fish oil (FMFO) industry [@Christensen et al. 2014]. This industry controls ~85% of the countries reported maritime landings and has an economic multiplier of 2.6. Thus, its effect on the sector’s economic performance is significant. However, its impact on the total employment multiplier is much smaller, despite being low (i.e., 1.77), as it only controls roughly ~13% of the sector’s employment. 

Given that different resources had different economic and employment multipliers [@Christensen et al. 2014] we estimated the total revenue and employment for the DHC industry between 2010 and 2016. In order to calculate the real contribution of the fisheries sector to the national economy, we took the off-vessel prices  and adjusted them to inflation by dividing them by the national price index for food items[^8], and then turned them into US dollars by applying the official PEN-USD exchange rate. The real off-vessel prices in USD/tonne were then multiplied by the total landings per group, and then by the economic multipliers listed in Christensen et al. (2014) in order to estimate the revenue found at sea and on land.

[^8]: Information downloaded from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru’s (BCRP) official webpage. Available at <http://www.bcrp.gob.pe/estadisticas.html>.

After removing the effect of the FMFO industry the DHC sector’s economic multiplier during the studied period was largest in 2011 with a value of 3.43, given the large landed volume of chub and Chilean jack mackerel. It then decreased and became more stable between 2013-2016 at an average of 3.15 ± 0.04. The average economic multiple for the whole studied period was of 3.19 ± 0.14.

Between 2010-2016, the total revenue of the DHC sector is estimated to be USD 23.30 billion. On average, USD 1.04 billion per year (± USD 0.14 billion per year) were made at sea and USD 3.33 billion per year (± USD 0.68 billion per year) were made on land (**S_Table 14**). This is consistent with the total real value of imports (total: USD 2.09 billion | average: USD 298 ± 52 million per year) and exports (total: USD 21.78 billion | average: USD 3.11 ± 0.57 billion per year) published by SUNAT (**S_Table 15**).

Estimating the total contribution of the sector to national employment is much harder, given that the small-scale fleet has continued to grow [@IMARPE, unpublished data], and the new technological advances have potentially changed the overall employment requirements of processing facilities. Using data from the third census of small-scale fisheries [@IMARPE, unpublished data], Peru had 67,427 active small-scale fishers in 2015. This represents a 53% increase since 2012, when the estimated small-scale fishermen population included 44,161 fishers [@Guevara-Carrasco & Bertrand 2017]. Applying the 2.9 multiplier for employment, the total contribution of the small-scale fisheries to national employment would be of 195,538 jobs [@Christensen et al. 2014]. 

Peruvian calico scallop (*Argopecten purpuratus*) and shrimp production has increased since 2009 [@PRODUCE 2017]. Given that in 2009 semi-intensive scallop aquaculture employed 0.257 people per tonne and had a 1.2 employment multiplier, whilst intensive shrimp aquaculture employed 0.176 people per tonne and had a 1.5 employment multiplier, production levels of 2015 would have resulted in 9,828 jobs before harvesting (60% from scallop aquaculture) and 3,135 jobs after harvest (38% in the farmed scallop value chains). The total jobs produced by aquaculture of marine resources would add up to 12,963 jobs.

Finally, although the total number of steel purse seiners that target anchoveta for FMFO have decreased, industrial vessels targeting mackerels, tuna and hake have not. According to Elena Conterno, president of the Peruvian Fisheries Society, these vessels employ roughly 3000 people at sea. After applying a 2.9 multiplier, this would result in a total of 8700 jobs for the sector (5700 on land).

In synthesis, the DHC value chains would have employed roughly 217,202 people (80,256 at sea and 136,946 on land) during 2015. The current estimate demonstrates that DHC value chains’ contribution to national employment has significant increased. Our values are comparable with what was estimated by Christensen et al. (2014), however they do not include the FMFO value chains, nor guano value chains, which together amounted to 13% of the fisheries sectors’ employment in 2009.

# Critical Analysis
<!-- ## Overall of the region -->

## Brazil

**Key messages:**

- *Fish and seafood consumption in Brazil is still incipient compared to other parts of the world*
- *Fisheries resources are an important source of food in the poorest regions of the country thus key for food security*
- *Fisheries in Brazil is mostly artisanal, with less than 5% of the registeres fishers from the industrial sector*
- *There is no national-level fisheries ststistics since 2008 in the country*
- *Aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry in Brazil*


### Data Uncertainty and Gaps

1. SIGSIF - This database contains self-reported data from seafood industries across the country. These companies report the weight of all seafood that entered their company. This seafood can sourced from aquaculture farms, fishing boats, local market and other seafood companies. These different sources are distinguished in the "origin" column. In case the seafood product is originated from another company that is also in this database, we have to be careful not to double count the product. For this reason is important to select only seafood that is originated from the producer (aquaculture or fisheries) to avoid overestimating the production. This can be easily done by filtering the data (origin == "PRODUTOR"). Another potential source of bias in this database, is through self-reporting errors. This is evident in the data from 2016, where production in one company from Rio de Janeiro exceeded 2 million tons, a clear typing error.     

2. CEAGESP - CEAGESP data is trustworthy and has very little uncertainty. Data collection is done by a contracted company that controls all the products that enters the market daily. 

3. MDIC - This database does not contain any important source of uncertainty, since all product imported or exported are rigorously checked by the government. 

4. State fisheries landings - These data have important sources of uncertainty. As with most landing data, in some years monitoring was not carried out in all landing sites. For example, in Santa Catarina state landing data the years 2014-2016 monitoring did not cover all landing sites due to lack of funding, generating an important bias on these years. In many cases, sampled catch was extrapolated to the entire fleet, also creating an important source of bias. Nonetheless, such landings data are the most complete of the country.   

5. IBGE - This data relies on questionnaires from a random household sample in each region of the country. Especially for seafood products, highest consumption rates are from isolated coastal and riverine communities. Therefore, there might be sampling biases related to this database in cases samples were concentrated near large metropolis. However, IBGE is recognized internationally for high quality research and for having robust sampling of all areas in the country. Another potential source of bias is the date of the study. The survey was done in 2008, which may not reflect fish consumption today.  

6. Fishing Permits - Although this database brings important information, there is a huge uncertainty regarding the number of fisher in the country. An important fraud is currently being investigated by non-fishers that are registered as artisanal fishers to receive an insurance for fisheries closure periods. According to the investigation, more than half of the insurance paid is irregular. In addition, many actual fishers do not have a fishing permit. Thus, this database is highly uncertain. 

During the study we identified several important data gaps in our analysis. First, there is no national-level fisheries statistics in the country since 2007, which hindered our ability to accurately respond some of the questions. Second, there is no data on the fisheries production from the artisanal sector, which accounts for more than half of the seafood production in the country. Third, there are very few studies on fish consumption in the country, with the most reliable studies dating back more than eight years. Fourth, there is very little information on the fisheries supply chain, especially from the artisanal sector. For the industrial sector, many of our databases did not have information on prices, which made it difficult to estimate the total income generated. 

### Seafood Consumption

**Key messages**:

- *Brazil relies heavly on seafood imports to supply growing demand for seafood in the country*
- *Fish and seafood products are crucial for food security in the poorest regions of the country*
- *Canned sardines are the most consumed fish product in the country*
- *From the main fish species consumed in Brazil, about half are from capture fisheries and half from aquaculture*

Domestic consumption of fish and seafood products in Brazil is still incipient compared to other countries around the globe (around 10kg/capita/year). Yet, because of Brazil's large population, consumption of fish and seafood product sums up to large amounts every year. To supply the domestic market, Brazil imports over 380k tons of seafood products every year. However, with increased aquaculture production (about 770k tons in 2017), domestic supply of fish and seafood products are rising quickly. 

Despite low per capita consumption across the country, consumption of fish in the poorest regions of the country can be very high. For example, the Amazon region has one of the highest fish consumption in the world, reaching 169kg/capita/year. Only in this state, it is estimated that about 80k tons of fish is consumed for subsistence of riverine communities.  In this study, we found that the poorest regions of the country are those that consume the most fish, which makes fisheries production crucial for food security. The North and Northeast regions are specially important since they  have the highest fish consumption per capita in the country, while having the lowest per capita income and the largest number of registered fishers in the country. 

According to the compiled databases, sardines are the most important fish for consumption in Brazil, especially through the canned market. It is an affordable alternative to other protein sources and is consumed all over the country. Other important resources for fish and seafood consumption in the country are: croakers, tilapia, catfish, cachuma, tunas, sharks, salmon, hake, among others. From these main species consumed, tilapia and cachuma are from national aquaculture production and salmon is imported mainly from Chile. The remaining species are from domestic capture fisheries. However, these results rely on data mostly from imports, aquaculture and the industrial sector (which comprises about 30-50% of catches in the country). The remaining production is from the small-scale sector, where there is basically no information on catches. Production from the artisanal sector is mainly consumed locally, with huge social importance in the country. This sector is characterized by having hundreds of commercially exploited species, where some of  the most important species are crabs, shrimps, lobster, snappers, groupers, mullet, weakfish and snook.

### Fisheries Employment and Income 

**Key messages**:

- *Fisheries has a significant social importance for Brazil, employing millions accross the entire supply chain*
- *About 95% of the registered fishers are from the artisanal sector*
- *According to our databases, sardine is the most valuable resource in the country*
- *Lobster exports are an imporant economic activity for artisanal fishers *

Total number of fishers in Brazil is very uncertain. According to different data sources, there are between 500k and 1 million fishers in the country, with the vast majority from the artisanal sector. When considering employment along the entire supply chain, fishing activities have enormous social importance for the country. 

According to our databases, sardines are the most valuable species in the country. The canned sardine and tuna market is crucial for the country's economy. Seafood industries that process these and other fish have an aggregated revenue of multiple billion dollars every year. Lobsters are also highly valuable for the country. It is the main exported species in Brazil and is captured exclusively by the artisanal fleet.

## Chile

### Data Uncertainty and Gaps

Most of our analysis relied on publically available data collected by governmental institutions. Although national efforts towards transparency and better data collection have increased over the years, there are still sources of uncertainty and error. Clear evidence of the presence of error in our analysis are the negative estimates of domestic consumption we got for some species after substracting exports to all what was produced in the country. Negative estimates are not logic since a country cannot export more than what it has produced. We think that these estimates can be mainly explain by the presence of Illegal unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), non-perfect matching between databases, and lack of information on species-specific yields and ingredients composition of marine products. 

Particularly concerning is landing data since it is mainly generated via landings declarations. Fishers should announce their intention to land catch to the authority in charge, who must weight and certify the catch. Commercialization centers should not sell any kind of catch that is not certified. Thus, fishers have an incentive to report their landings. In addition, those fishers that do not declare their landings risk their permits and penalty fees. Still, these rules are poorly enforced generating incentives to underreport. IUU fishing occurs in Chile. In 2017, the five most seized species due to non-compliance with fishing regulations were the Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*), the Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), the Giant grey kelp (*Lessonia nigrescens*), the Jumbo Flying Squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and the South pacific hake (*Merluccius gayi*). All of them are among the most landed species in the country. There has been recent efforts to generate estimates for IUU for some Chilean fisheries like Loco (*Concholepas concholepas*) (@oyanedel_illegal_2018) and the South pacific hake (@wwfchile_estimacion_2017). However, we did not include them in our analysis because they are not available for all species and including them only for the species that have been studied could have bias our results in a systematic way. IUU is not recorded in the landings database but products coming from IUU that are exported are likely to be recorded in the exports database. This could be making us to underestimate domestic consumption. 

The lack of consistency in data collection between and within agencies brings another source of uncertainty to our analysis. We found inconsistencies between two databases of landings published by SERNAPESCA in their website. They differed in the level at which data was aggregated. One data base was clasified per secto (artisanal, industria, fabric vessels) and the other was the summary for lanfings and aquaculture for each year pero region. When we aggregated the most detailed database to the same level as the anual summary database we observed differences in landing volumes for the year 2015. We considered this to be part of the measurement error involved in any process of data collection or data entry. We used the summary annual data dor our domestic human consumption model because it alinged more with amounts reported all other years.

A major challenge was to match trade and landings data. SERNAPESCA collects data under the common names while Aduanas Chile record exported and imported products under the international Harmonized System nomenclature. To overcome this issue we use the information provided by Aduanas Chile on the species contained in some types of products. This allowed us to aggregate products per groups of species and match volumes and values to landing record by SERNAPESCA. In addition, SERNAPESCA applies several variations of a species common name between databases. This difficults the calculation of aggregated estimates. We solve this by generating a dataset that categorize all the names currently used by SERNAPESCA under a common group among the import and export data (See appendix for group details). We designated the groups and did all the corresponfing matching, this step is prone to human error.

It is possible that we have overestimated exports volumes for some species since some products combine the species of interest with other ingredients. We could not account for this since we did not have data on the products composition on different ingredients. However, for the most exported products this is not a major issue since fish fillets and fresh products are usually almost 100% made by fish meat or shellfish. Similarly, we lacked data on species-specific yields to estimate how many Kg of a species translates into different marine products. To fill this gap, we use information from Peru on production yields and apply it to Chilean species. Some of them were excatly the same species but for those that did not present a match in Peru we use the yield of the most similar species. We found our analysis to be particularly sensitive to the values of species-specific yields, highlighting the importance of improving this aspect of the model.

A major information gap we identified is the lack of publically available data on ex-vessel prices and employment for the industrial sector. To our knowledge neither SERNAPESCA, IFOP nor SUBPESCA collect data on this regard. Thus, identifying what were the most valuable species for the industrial sector was not possible. An approach we were unable to apply due to time constraints is to derive ex-vessel prices from trade data (@melnychuk_reconstruction_2017). Contrary to what we expected, the fisheries sector for which we found most available information was the artisanal sector. We were able to get a count of the direct employment generated by the artisanal sector thanks to the National Record of Artisanal Fishers (RPA). Still, we cannot ensure we are not underestimating the number of people that rely on fishing. We know enforcement is weak specially in remote areas of the country therefore there is room for illigal activity. We were also able to estimate species-specific revenues by using landings and prices of first transactions. Finally, information on employees in processing facilities was also available. However, some values were unrealistic since they were larger than the entire population of the country. Thus, we prefered relied on a survey study performed by IFOP to fullfill this estimate.   

We also lacked data on the transportation of landings and products between Chilean regions and final destination. This prevented us from applying our model of food supply at the regional level. The problem is that the catch landed in one region could be processed in a different one and then the final product sold in a third region. Running the regional analysis without accounting for this issue would have led to incorrect estimates of food consumption. 

### Fisheries context

-  The most important fisheries in Chile in terms of landings have been Anchovy (*Engraulis ringens*), Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphy*i) and Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*) (*Figure 1*), all three of them mainly catch by the industrial fleet. This pelagic fishes are mainly used to produce fish meal therefore not for human consumption. 

### Seafood Consumption

**Key messages**:

- *Most importants species and products in terms of food consumption.*
- *Trends in food consumption.*
- *Lack of understanding on what species are the most important for domestic consumption.* 
- *Despite its massive production, aquaculutre is not a major source of food supply for the Chilean population. Most of its production is exported and the species being farmed either go to non-human consumption (algae) or are too expenssive to be accessed by lower income groups which is the population of interest in the contxt of food security.* 

We found that Chileans moslty rely on pelagic fisheries as their primary source for seafood. The most important groups of species for domestic food consumption are squids, tuna, hake, and the Southern ray beam. However, it is likely that we have overestimated squid consumption. It is worth noting that Tuna is mostly imported into the country while most of the species that are use in Chile for Human Consumption products like salmon, trouts and mussels are exported. This reflects the importance of market forces on world-wide seafood distirbution and supply. Salmon and trouts get better prices a broad and are too expensive for Chileans in general. 

Although our is just a preliminary approach, we found that Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and Sea Urchins (*Loxechinus albus*) are species that are being conssumed without going through processing facilities. We believe this species are mostly sold close to their landing points and therefore are important for coastal communities livelihoods.

Seafood consumption in Chile has been shown to be correlated with income, as in other parts of the world. However, the data is spotty and is provably missing some of the consumption that occurs in coastal communities.


### Economic participation

Aquaculuture is the most important activity in the fisheries sector in terms of economic value. Their profits come mainly from the exportation of salmon products. This positions salmons as the group of marine species that contribute the most to the country's economy. The Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*) and the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) are the wild-caught species that have contributed the most in exports over the pasts years. The latter is use for DHC and is targeted by both the artisanal an industrial sector. Yet, current discussion on closing access to the industrials to this fishery could bring consequences for both income and food supply. 

Among wild-caught fisheries the ones that seems to generate more revenues for the artisanal sector are the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*). While the first fishery occurs only in the South of the country, the latter is ditributed along the coast of Chile.

Although the direct employment in aquaculture centers is low relative to the number of artisanal fishers, it is very likely that an important share of the job positions in the manufacturing sector are being supported by aquaculture. Especially in the South where most job positions for manufacturing of human consumption products are concetrated. The role of Algaes in terms of employment for the artisanal sector is also worth notice. The revenues of most these species are not particularly high, however the lower costs of extraction relative to other types of fishing make algae collection an attractive form of livelihood for coastal communities.

### Data Uncertanty

**Key messages:**

- *Although data is readily available, its reliability remains unclear.*
- *Government systems for fisheries data collection, including trade data, insert bias in national statistics and hinder their interpretation.*


<!-- Although data is readily available, its reliability is somewhat questionable given the lack of transparency regarding data collection and management practices. For example, the Peruvian Ministry of Production (PRODUCE) reports capture production for the country on an annual basis [PRODUCE 2012; 2013; 2015a; 2015b; 2016; 2017]. PRODUCE gathers monthly affidavits from all industrial processing companies detailing the amount of raw materials used (by species or group of species) for their different lines of production [PRODUCE 2017]. This includes inputs for reduction (i.e., fishmeal and fish oil -FMFO- production) and for direct human consumption (DHC). The latter includes canning, curing and freezing seafood. Companies are also required to report the total production by product type and species group (e.g., tonnes of frozen mahi-mahi fillets). Industrial aquaculture sites along the coast, are also required to supply affidavits detailing their production yields by species [PRODUCE 2017]. -->

<!-- Moreover PRODUCE collects data from: (i) the administrators of different artisanal landings sites (Desembarcaderos Pesqueros Artesanales, DPAs) along the coast, which report the total amount of algae, fish and marine invertebrates that were weighed on site [Sueiro & De la Puente 2015], (ii) the Peruvian Marine Research Institute (Instituto del Mar del Perú, IMARPE), which monitors a representative sample of the small-scale fisheries activity along the Peruvian coast [Estrella & Swartzman 2010; Guevara-Carrasco & Bertrand 2017], and (iii) the Regional Directions of Production (Direcciones Regionales de Producción, DIREPROs), the equivalent of PRODUCE at a Regional Government level . DIREPROs estimate the total small-scale capture and aquaculture production occurring within their region [Sueiro & De la Puente 2015]. -->

<!-- PRODUCE also gathers information from different fresh seafood wholesaler markets in the coastal regions of Peru. These report on a daily basis the amount of seafood sold on site by species and at their corresponding price.  -->

PRODUCE estimates the monthly capture and aquaculture production by combing various sources of governmental information (monthly reports from DPAs, IMARPE and DIREPROs, together with monthly affidavits from industrial fisheries processing facilities and aquaculture producing sites). However, the methods used by PRODUCE for combining the multiple data sets, have never been published and were not available when requested for the present work. This lack of transparency weakens our trust in the information provided by PRODUCE. 

It is key to highlight that PRODUCE’s estimates of marine and freshwater capture production are a reconstruction of the landings rather than the catch [@DelaPuenteetal. 2013; @Sueiro & De la Puente 2015]. For some species, like sharks for example, the catch is severely underestimated because these fishes are headed and gutted on board [@DelaPuente2017]. Important discards are not accounted for in landings other species including common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*) [@DelaPuenteetal2015], and Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) [@Paredes & De la Puente 2014].

Moreover, PRODUCE underestimates the maritime capture production because it does not account for illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which can be very significant in the small-scale fisheries [@Mendo & Wosnitza-Mendo 2014]. A potential source for this is the data-collection system itself. Species listed in industrial affidavits and/or reports from DIREPROs and DPAs are described using common names, which often vary from site to site (e.g., ‘*jurel*’, ‘*furel*’ and ‘*cairel*’ are all used in reference to the Chilean Jack mackerel *Trachurus murphyi*) or are used to describe different species (e.g., ‘*pampanito*’ is used for the Peruvian moonfish *Selene peruviana*, the starry butterfish *Stromateus stellatus*, and the Paloma pompano *Trachinotus paitensis*), or often use non-informative categories (e.g., ‘*tollo*’ or ‘*tiburón*’ can be used to describe any shark species [@LopezdelaLamaet al. 2018b]). As a result, landings of marine living resources reported by IMARPE for the 1997-2015 period include registries for at least 258 fish species, 43 species of mollusks, 30 species of crustaceans, 4 species of echinoderms, 4 species of brown algae, 2 species of red algae and 1 species of tunicate (**Table S1**); whilst landings reported by PRODUCE only included 45 species and/or groups of species, reported using common names only (29 for fishes; 9 for mollusks, 2 for crustaceans, 1 for echinoderms, 1 for macroalgae and 3 for unspecified resources – other fishes, other invertebrates, other species). 

Additionally, affidavits from industrial seafood processing companies are hardly ever verified (Patricia Majluf and Hector Soldi , pers. comm.). As a result, some products had very unrealistic yields (e.g., landings of macroalgae were much smaller than the reported cured algae production and export), or manifested mistaken information (e.g., landings of Atlantic salmon reported off Lima). Contracts for DPA administration, as well as operational manuals for DPA administrators, fail to include mandates regarding data collection for fisheries management [@PRODUCE 2010]. As a result, DPAs lack common or standardized formats for data collection, leading to confusion and error. Moreover, as DPAs are taxed in reference the amount of the fish (and marine invertebrates) landed at the sites, their administrators have a strong economic incentive to underreport them. DPAs ought to be monitored by DIREPROs and PRODUCE, but these institutions lack the man-power and resources to properly impose the rule of law within the fisheries sector [@De la Puente & Sueiro 2013]. 

Alike marine captures, freshwater capture production is severely underestimated [@SueiroDelaPuente2015]. Most of the catch never goes through a landing site and is used for subsistence, as can be seen from the difference in volume reported by PRODUCE and from ENAHO [@AComerPescado 2015; @SueiroDelaPuente 2015; PRODUCE 2016].

Finally, regarding to trade SUNAT records shipments coming in and going out of Peru with great care. They conduct a census of the shipments, rather than just sampling them. However, shipments are sorted by ‘customs codes’, which group together multiple product types and species. Using the general and specific commercial description of each shipment, it is possible to re-arrange their dataset into something more meaningful for monitoring international trade of fisheries and aquaculture products. However, some shipments include multiple species without detailing how much of the total weight corresponds to a particular species (e.g., shipments labeled only as ‘frozen shrimp and mahi-mahi’). The latter are hardly ever segregated with certainty. Nonetheless, the practice of cleaning SUNAT’s data is not something undertaken by PRODUCE, due to limited manpower. As a result, they use customs codes to assess trends in trade, which leads them to interpretation errors.

In synthesis, uncertainty in Peruvian fisheries and aquaculture data is an issue that requires closer attention. It is of paramount importance to improve transparency. Not only in terms of fisheries governance [@DelaPuente & Sueiro 2013; @Heck 2015; @Gutierrez & Sueiro 2017], but also in terms of the data used to inform policy [@DelaPuente et al. 2013; @SueiroDelaPuente 2015]. This is not just an issue for decision makers within the government, but also is a key requirement to secure compliance with international agreements such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Luckily, Peru has recently signed the Agreement of Escazú (i.e., *Acuerdo Regional sobre el Acceso a la Información, la Participación Pública y el Acceso a la Justicia en Asuntos Ambientales en América Latina y el Caribe*), which is aimed at increasing available information to assist decision making processes, increase public participation and foster transparency.


### Fisheries context

**Key messages:**

-	*Most Peruvian capture production is still destined for fishmeal and fish oil production.*
-	*Aquaculture production continues to increase throughout Peru.*
-	*Most capture and aquaculture production enter value chains that aim to produce frozen seafood for export.*


Peru is well known as an anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) fishing country. Although anchoveta landings have decreased by 40% in the last five years (in comparison to the previous five-year period) [@PRODUCE 2017]; this specie still dominates national capture production. Most of its catch is used for reduction, even though Peruvian have severe nutritional deficits and a transition to value chains for direct human consumption (DHC) would increase the contribution of this marine living resource to the economy [@Majluf et al. 2016]. 

As revealed by this study, DHC capture production in Peru is mostly used in value chains that target foreign markets, where jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) plays a key role. Moreover, marine aquaculture production is also tailored to foreign markets. As a result, freshwater aquaculture production is increasing at a much faster rate and supplying both national markets and foreign markets.

###	Seafood consumption

**Key messages:**

-	*Seafood consumption is increasing in Peru, regardless of the method used to estimate it.*
-	*Due to issues with trade data, the National Seafood Supply was significantly lower than the Total Apparent Seafood Consumption.*
- *The Andes mountain range is a mayor barrier for supplying seafood to Peruvian regions located in the highlands and the Amazon. *
- *Peruvians living in the Amazon declare high levels of consumption of freshwater species, locally caught or farmed for subsistence.*

As previously reported by De la Puente (2017) [@delapuente2017], overall catches for direct human consumption have remained somewhat stable between 2006 and 2016. Given that total and per capita seafood consumption continues to rise in Peru, Peruvian dependence on seafood imports is rapidly increasing in order to ameliorate the growing unsatisfied local seafood demand. Greater demand for seafood is thought to be jeopardizing certain key species for the restaurant trade, and hence local NGOs have started to work with chefs to strengthen the sustainable seafood movement [@Lopez de la Lama et al. 2018c].

The multiple methods used to estimate seafood consumption in Peru revealed that Peruvians mostly eat highly nutritional fishes (e.g., mackerels, bonito and small pelagics), with relatively low tropic levels (except for tunas and sharks). Nonetheless, the Andes mountain range is a serious barrier to seafood consumption, as can be seen by the low DSCpc reported for Peruvian regions found in the highlands and the Amazon (**Table 10**). These regions have the highest nutritional deficits and have some of the lowest values of GDP per capita within Peru [@AComerPescado 2015; @Majluf et al. 2016]. This is key to understanding regional seafood availability. As seafood consumption increases with growing household incomes [@AComerPescado 2015; @Higuchi et al. 2017], seafood continues to remain close to shore and particularly in Lima (**Table 10**), given that the coastal regions of Peru report the largest economic growth within the country [@DelaPuente et al. 2013].

It is also worth noting that some key species for DSCT were not relevant for ASCT and vice versa. The Chilean silverside (*Odontesthes regia*), lorna drum (*Sciaena deliciosa*) and Peruvian weakfish (*Cynoscion analis*) were more important contributors to total food security in DSCT than in ASCT. This could be explained as ENAHO revealing a higher unreported supply of these fishes in Peru or consumers being misled (consumer fraud) and sold mislabeled seafood at their local markets. These species have been traditionally consumed in Peru [@Sueiro & De la Puente 2015] and are praised by consumers [@AComerPescado 2015]. As seafood products are easier to sell when consumers know the species being sold and have a history of consuming it [@Carlucci et al. 2015]; perhaps this reveals a market strategy aimed at securing a purchase whilst diluting environmental (i.e., decrease in local supply of a particular species) [@Crona et al. 2016]. This could also explain why jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) and common dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*) are not as important for DSCT in relation to ASCT. Both of these species are relatively new to Peruvian consumers and not heavily sought seafood items [@SueiroDelaPuente 2015]. This is an important aspect to consider when promoting seafood consumption in the Peruvian Andes and Amazon. Increased seafood supply will not necessarily translate to increased consumption, if it is not accompanied by efforts to: (a) promote positive interactions between seafood and local populations, and (b) teach people how to preserve and prepare seafood.

Additionally, ENAHO does not report frozen seafood consumption. This is a result of local legislation, as seafood wholesalers and retailers are not required to inform consumers whether or not the seafood item being sold is local or if it was previously frozen [@DelaPuente 2017].

Moreover, when comparing ASCT and NSS, the latter presented much lower values. This is because SUNAT registers the net weight of the shipments entering and leaving the country and not the weight of seafood products within them. As Peru is a net exporter of seafood, when not properly accounted for the NSS method will underestimate local seafood supply. On this note, PRODUCE used to publish values for total and per capita apparent consumption of fish and aquatic invertebrates in Peru in their annual statistical reports [@PRODUCE 2015a]. They claim to use the same method for estimating ASCT as we did, however they produce much higher values, and have been heavily criticized for overestimating seafood consumption due to lack of precision and void assumption [@AComerPescado 2015]. 

Finally, it is important to highlight that people living in the Peruvian Amazon are not deprived of fish. Subsistence fishing is very important for local nutrition, albeit not being so in maritime regions [@Mendo & Wosnitza-Mendo 2014; @Sueiro & De la Puente 2015]. For example, Loreto only reports a DSCpc of 1.66 kg per person (Figure 26). However, when including local freshwater species, the total declared consumption of aquatic living resources reaches 47.4 kg per person. 

This reveals a highly resilient problem in Peru that originates from the large extent of catch underreporting in the Amazon. PRODUCE and DIREPRO are unable to prioritize actions to improve fisheries monitoring in the Amazon as landings appear to be insignificant in the national statistics. Given that they are unaware of trends in species biomass, catches or catches per unit of effort, the government is unable to implement actions to improve fisheries managements. As these institutions are unaware of how fisheries actually operate in these areas, and fishers hardly ever interact with government officials, regulations tend to be inadequate and are systematically ignored by local stakeholders. The total lack of government oversight is not only problematic for communities seeking support to block large infrastructure projects (e.g., dams) that would negatively impact their food security, but also makes them highly vulnerable to climate change and overfishing.


### Economic participation

**Key message:**
-	*The contribution of direct human consumption value chains to the national economy is severely underestimated by the Ministry of Production, however it is increasing and gaining importance over fishmeal and fish oil value chains.*


PRODUCE estimates the fisheries sector’s contribution to the national economy disregarding seafood processing for direct human consumption. The latter’s contribution to employment and GDP is rather counted as part of the manufacturing sector [@DelaPuente et al. 2013; @Christensen et al. 2014]. Hence, DHC industries have not received the attention needed, both in terms of regulations and enforcement. This has led to a progressive weakening of the rule of law (@DelaPuente & Sueiro 2013). This claim can be warranted by the ever-growing Peruvian small-scale fishing fleet. Despite multiple legal bills and other regulatory efforts to close access to new vessels aiming to target fully exploited marine living resources, this fleet continues to increase [@Guevara-CarrascoBertrand 2017; IMARPE, unpublished data]. Fishers are already seeing their profits eroded and continue to be pushed the perverse and very resilient cycles of Malthusian overfishing [@Finkbeiner et al. 2017].

Our estimates of the sector’s overall revenue show a relative decrease in the value of DHC value chains since 2011. It is key to highlight, however, that these values are only referential as have been estimated under heavy assumptions. A much closer look is needed to understand the economic dynamics of the Peruvian fisheries sector. This is definitely a research gap that needs to be dealt with in order to properly balance trade-offs and assess the economic and social impacts of alternative fisheries policies aimed at advancing towards the ecosystem-based management of the Humboldt current and its marine living resources.

# Conclusions

## Brazil

Regardless of data gaps, this study was able to gather the best information available in Brazil. The study highlighted the huge importance of fisheries for income, employment and food security in Brazil. With data from the seafood industry and seafood markets, we now have a better understanding of the main seafood products consumed in the country. With data from IBGE and fisheries licenses, we were able to highlight the importance of fish and seafood products for food security in the poorest parts of the country. Regional landings data helped us better understand the main species caught in some of the most important ports in the country. Import and export data showed the magnitude of the seafood deficit in the country, with a huge potential for aquaculture to fill this gap. 

More importantly, this study highlights the need for better data collection programs and fisheries management policies in Brazil. There is a huge discrepancy between the social importance of this sector and actions of the government to ensure the sustainability of this activity. Urgent action is needed to better understand this important sector and to gain the attention of policy makers to invest in fisheries management. 

To invest in fisheries reform in Brazil, it is important to start with a reform of the legal structure around fisheries governance. The lack of fisheries data and management in the country is mainly caused by a huge confusion in the government around the responsibilities and obligations regarding fisheries governance. Currently, fisheries governance is under both the secretary of fisheries and the ministry of environment. However, there is a confusion on the duties and responsibilities of each department. For example, it is not clear which department is responsible for fisheries statistics in the country. In addition, the fisheries secretariat is very unstable and understaffed, serving as political bargain for politicians to gain votes. Therefore, to begin solving Brazil's fisheries management and data problems, the country urgently needs a new national fisheries law. A new fisheries law could define clear roles and responsibilities to government agencies, create a permanent fisheries institute to deal with data collection and management (that is independent of politics), create rights-based policies for artisanal and industrial sectors, among others. Currently, Brazil's national fisheries law does not provide proper conditions for fisheries management and data collection and lags behind compared to other Latin American countries such as Chile and Mexico. Therefore, if resources were available to invest in Brazil fisheries reform, it could be spent assisting in the creation of a new national fisheries law for Brazil. It is a challenging task, but a much needed step towards fisheries sustainability in the country.

## Peru

Peruvian seafood production plays a key role for national food security. Locals mostly eat highly nutritious species like mackerels, bonito, tunas and hake. However, the country’s most important fisheries (i.e., anchoveta and jumbo flying squid fisheries) and marine crops (i.e., Peruvian calico scallop and shrimps) mainly supply foreign markets. As a result, the local seafood demand is unsatisfied and becoming more reliant on seafood imports and freshwater aquaculture production. A phenomenon that is heightened on years with low catches of traditional seafood items (e.g., mackerels, bonito, tunas and sharks). 

Consumers are unaware of this because seafood retailers are not required to communicate whether or not what they are selling was locally caught, imported or previously frozen. Moreover, mislabelling is common in Peruvian markets. These issues downplay marine signals indicating ecological stress, whilst reduce stakeholder interest, participation and support for promoting improved fisheries management and marine conservation. 

Seafood’s contribution to the economy is growing in Peru. They are responsible for creating and sustaining most jobs it the Peruvian fisheries sector (on land and at sea) and are gaining significance over reduction industries in regard to exports and their participation in the country’s GDP. However, value chains supplying the local seafood demand are not properly understood and hence have not received the required Government attention. 

Oceana should seek to improve public understanding of seafood value chains. This is of paramount importance in gaining support to promote new regulations and policies in favour of strengthening fisheries management. Furthermore, it has the potential to strengthen the contribution of marine ecosystems to Peruvian food security, increase the fisheries sector’s participation in the economy and reduce its vulnerability to climate change. 

This requires improving data collection and management systems across government institutions. A good first step in the right direction could be the participatory development data protocols that describe the specific actions for government employees and contractors (including DPA administrators) in regard to why, how, when and where to collect, store and upload data. Government workers should be trained and re-trained in the application of these protocols and their implementation should be closely monitored to continuously strengthen the system. 
Additionally, it is of paramount importance to assess current data management processes and provide short-term solutions for reconstructing past information and reduce bottlenecks for cross-institutional data sharing. 

Furthermore, seafood traceability issues are currently hindering trade. This should be dealt with in the short-term by fostering changes in the regulations that would require stakeholders to submit and collect specific information along the seafood value chains. This should be a participatory process, that considers the attitudes, objectives and capacities of the different players (e.g., DPA administrators, PRODUCE and SUNAT personnel, processing companies, exporters, fishers, among others), and explicitly considers their potential costs and gains from improving traceability.

These efforts should be coupled with the development of outreach campaigns to promote consumer awareness on seafood related issues and foster sustainable consumer practices. This can range from campaign aiming to increase knowledge and respect for regulations (e.g., minimum landing sizes and seasons), to others highlighting sustainable seafood choices for consumers, or promoting improved seafood labeling regulations.

Moreover, it is important for Oceana to position itself as a key player seeking to increase seafood’s contribution to Peruvian food security, particularly in the eyes of the government and seafood companies. This could be achieved by collaborating with current public and private efforts promoting sustainable seafood consumption, particularly in areas with nutritional deficits. 
Finally, Oceana should assist the government in developing fisheries management plans, regulations promoting co-management of marine resources, methods for sustainably increasing seafood production (e.g., multi-trophic aquaculture using native species) and marine governance tools. Perhaps for the latter, a useful contribution could be collaborating with IMARPE and PRODUCE in developing predictive models that encompass the ecological and social dimensions of marine ecosystems, which could be used by these stakeholders to assess trade-offs amongst alternative public policies regarding fisheries management and seafood trade.

## Chile
### Methods


Any conversion from Chilean pesos to dollars was done by first converting the amount in Chilean pesos to its value in Chilean Units of account (UF, a monetary unit corrected by inflation) of the respective year. Then, transformed to the equivalent in 2018 Chilean pesos using the 2018 UF value and finally, converting the 2018 value in Chilean pesos to its equivalent in 2018 US dollars, based on the conversion for Dec, 2018 (1 US dollars corresponds to 676 Chilean pesos).
