### Country-specific data, Chile

1. *SERNAPESCA* -SERNAPESCA - The Chilean National Service of Fisheries is the main entity in charge of keeping track of landings and other fisheries and aquaculture related data in Chile. Most of their data is available on their website but we also obtained additional databases upon request[C^1]. We accessed their databases on landings from wild-caught and farmed fisheries, first transaction prices (ex-vessel price) for artisanal fisheries, and landings used in different types of sea products. These databases provided information at the species and regional level. We also downloaded their data on the geographical distribution of production facilities and the types of sea products they produce. We issued data requests on SERNAPESCA’s portal to obtain more detailed information. Via this method, they provided us the national record of artisanal fishers (RPA), which lists current registered fishers and boats, and the national record of industrial vessels (RPI), which lists current registered industrial vessels. The RPA informs the region, gender and age for each artisanal fisher as well as the species-specific permits they hold. Together the RPA and RPI provide information on artisanal and industrial vessels, including length and storing capacity. SERNAPESCA also provided the number of employees of each gender per processing facility.

[^C1]: Chilean National Service of Fisheries. Data available athttp://www.sernapesca.cl/informes/estadisticas

2. *Aduanas Chile (Chilean Customes)*. is the main entity in charge of keeping records of imported and exported goods in the country. We accessed their exports and imports data by product and region via their website. Each product in the original exports and imports datasets is identified through an ID number that matches the name of the product in a code known as the Arancel Aduanero. Most products provided details on the species or groups of species involved.

3. *IFOP* - The Fisheries Development Institute is a private entity that advises fisheries management based on permanent biological, environmental and economic monitoring, and scientific reasoning. Although most of the data collected by IFOP pertains to stock assessments and biological indicators, they also generate economically relevant statistics. We reviewed their most recent annual report on the economic monitoring of Chilean fisheries for 2015. It includes databases and estimates for employment. We also extracted data from their monthly reports on exports of fisheries products, which are based on ADUANAS's data.  

4. *CCB* - The Chilean Central Bank (*Banco Central de Chile*) is the entity in charge of establishing the Chilean currency. To fulfill its function it monitors the main economic indicators per economic sector. We accessed their data on sectorial GDP (including fisheries) for each region. 

5. We reviewed several reports from other national agencies like the Undersecretary of Fisheries (SUBPESCA), NGOs and scientific publications to complement our analysis.

### Fisheries Context

To evaluate the volume contribution of specific fisheries over the last five years, we used records of landings and aquaculture harvests from SERNAPESCA  (2013-2017). Using monthly data  published by IFOP, we identified the most exported fish products in terms of volume. To identify the participation of different species in exported volumes we generated a new database linking types of products listed in the *Arancel Aduanero* with the names of the fished and farmed species listed by SERNAPESCA. We searched for all the products ids that refer to the species scientific name, common name or genus name as listed by SERNAPESCA and aggregated them under the species name.

#### Wild Caught Fish

##### Main wild-caught fisheries in terms of volume 

According to landing records from SERNAPESCA over the last five years, the artisanal sector lands on average 1.6 ± 0.58 million annual tonnes of marine species while the industrial sector lands around 0.9 ± 0.16 million tonnes per year. Is worth noting that large part of the artisanal landings are of algae and benthic species that are not targeted by the industrial sector. Both sectors have among their most landed species the Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) and the Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*), two species that are mostly used as inputs for fish meal and oil (Figure 19). Other important species in artisanal landings are the Giant grey kelp (*Lessonia nigrescens*), exported mostly as dried algae, and the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), mostly commercialized fresh or frozen for human consumption (HC). The Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*) is also an important fishery in terms of volume for the industrial sector, which is also mostly used in the production of fish meal and oil and to a lesser extent for direct HC. 

Over the last years the catch composition of the artisanal sector has presented no major changes except from one species of algae (Giant brown kelp, *Lessonia trabeculata*) replacing other (Red algae gracilaria, *Gracilaria spp*) within the top 5 landed species as for 2013. In the case of the industrial sector, composition of the main species is also stable over the last years. Yet, the landings of Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) started decreasing in 2014 relative to previous years, this incresed the relevance of other species like the Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*). Other important species for the artisanal sector are   (Table Chile S1).

##### Regional Diferences in volumes of wild-caught fisheries

Landed tons for 2017 shows that the amount of landings varies widely along the coast of Chile for both artisanal and industrial sectors. Figure 20 show the mean total landing per sector and region. The color of the bars represents the most landed species in 2017. We observe that the VIII region is by far the region with most landings from both sectors. However, the industrial sector also concentrate landings in the north of the country while artisanals are more spread. The most landed species in 2017 also varies by region but has changed little over the last five years (**Table App.3** and **Table App.4**). 

```{r Landings_per_region, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= 'Mean annual total landings per region for the artisanal (left pannel) and industrial sector (right pannel) between 2013 and 2017. The color represents the most landed species in 2017. Error bars represent one standard deviation. Note that scales are different between pannels.

#### Aquaculture production

##### Main farmed fisheries in terms of volume

The main species harvested from aquaculture centers in the last 5 years have been the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), Coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*), mussels (*Mytilus chilensis*) and the Red algae gracilaria (*Gracilaria spp.*) in descending order (Figure 21). Overall, the composition of the most farmed species and its volumes have been stable over the last 5 years. However, the Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) seems to be becoming less important over recent years.

```


##### Regional Diferences in farmed fisheries

Aquaculture production is highly concentrated in the South of the country, between the X and the XII regions (Figure 22). Nevertheless, from the I to the IV region the most farmed resources are algaes and scallops (*Argopecten purpuratus*) (**Table App.5**). The red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) became the most farmed in 2013 in the V region, replacing the Turbot (*Scophtalmus maximus*). Towards the south salmons and trouts are the most farmed species along with some algaes and mussels (*Mytilus chilensis*). The most farmed species in the austral south are the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) and the Chilean mussel (*Mytilus chilensis*).

#### Fish Trade
 
Around 72% of the landings from fisheries and aquaculture are exported outside the country (@ifop_monitoreo_2015). The main species exported is Atlantic salmon produced in aquaculture, followed by far by jack mackerel (Figure 23-A). Tuna leads the import activities followed, also by far, by jack mackerel (Figure 23-B)

### Estimating National Seafood Supply

Because seafood can be supplied by different sectors, we combine the multiple datasets collected for this study to include aquaculture, wild capture, and international trade. Names in the FAO trade data were standardized as possible to match the taxa and species groups in the catch and consumption data. Results suggest that the main fish group destined for food in Brazil is tilapia, salmon in Chile and anchoveta in Peru (Table 5). However, as discussed below (see each country’s section) these results might not represent the main food sources as regional dynamics (e.g.subsistence fishing, fishers interactions) might not be captured by international data sources by country. These differences might result from regional and local dynamics (e.g.subsistence fishing, fishers interactions) not being accuarately captured by international data sources. The latter might also be subject to bias driven by methodological assumptions included for catch reconstructions, or to error from data manipulation and incorrect data sharing between national government fisheries institutions and FAO. Finally, because FAO trade data is arranged by product (e.g.American and European Lobsters Homarus.spp, whole, frozen) it is very challenging to match such products with the actual species or species group. 

Based on our results, Brazil’s seafood supply comes mainly from aquaculture of tilapia, cachama (*Colossoma macropomum*), and shrimp, and imports of Atlantic salmon, Alaska pollock, and herrings, sardines, and anchovies. In the case of Chile, the main sources of seafood are landings of species such as jumbo squid or mackerels, and aquaculture with species such as Atlantic salmon and Chilean mussel. Finally, Peru’s national seafood supply comes mainly from landings with the main three species beign anchoveta, squid, and jack mackerel.

As previouslly mentioned, matching FAO-trade data with captures can be quite challenging. As a matter of fact, when comparing the estimated NSS from international and national datasets in Peru, we found that, althou the species composition is not that different, quantities change a lot. This is mainly because as seen in **Table X**, the model was not able to account for any positive net trade of the species due to the missmatch between the FAO trade and wilde capture data.

```{r NSS_Complement, eval=F, echo=F}

x<- International_D %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Species,"mackerel")) %>% 
  group_by(Species, Country) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(Aquaculture:Discards),

### Estimating National Economic Participation

Fisheries are important to local and national economies of most Latin American countries. Of the case study countries, the fishing sector (counting only landed values) has the highest GDP contribution in Peru (2.3%) and lowest in Brazil (<1%). By using a multiplier developed by Dyck and Sumaila [@Dyck] we can estimate the total impact of the fisheries industry (supply chain) in the country’s GDP. Such multiplier (2.05 for Latin american countries) boosts the GDP contribution to 2.6% in Chile and 4.7% in Peru (Brazil maintains under 1%).


```{r Per_PIB_T, eval =T,echo=F}

# PIB de World Bank
data.frame(
  Brazil = c(2209,2616,2465),
  Chile = c(218.5,252.3,267.1),
  Peru = c(153.9,176.7,192.6)
) %>% 
  gather("Reporter","GDP",1:3) %>% 
  group_by(Reporter) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>% 
  left_join(SAU_Totals_Plot,
            by = "Reporter") %>% 
  filter(Variable == "Landings_Value") %>% 
  mutate(
    GDP_Des = ifelse(Reporter %in% c("Chile","Peru"), GDP*1000000000,GDP*100000000000), #Billion
    "Landed value" = Totals,
    "Total Economic Impact" = round(Totals*2.05,1), # From Dyke and Sumaila
    "Household Income" = Totals * 0.56,
    "% of GDP" =round(`Total Economic Impact`/GDP_Des*100,3)
  ) %>% 
  select(-Variable,-GDP_Des, -GDP, -Totals) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(2:4),funs(round(./1000000000,2))) %>%
  rename(Country=Reporter) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Fisheries contributions to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Total economic impact includes indirect and induced effects of the fisheries sector. Data based on economic impact multipliers reported in Dyck and Sumaila (2010) for each country. All values in USD billions.", 
    booktabs = T,
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
    )

```

In terms of economic contribution of specific fish landings, Brazil’s most valuable fishery between 2012 and 2014 was *Umbrina canosai*, a croaker fished in the southern part of the country. For Chile, the most valuable fishery was anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*). Peru’s most valuable fishery in 2014 was the Peruvian scallop (*Argopecten purpuratus*) (Figure 8). International databases describing ex-vessel prices are also subject to error and biased estimates, as was the case for capture production (FAO) and reconstructed catch (SAU). Thus, the most valuable fisheries per country might also differ when estimates use national and international datasets (see Peru - National Economic Participation).

Trade is an important component of fisheries. From the countries analyzed Brazil was the only country to have an overall net import of fish. Brazil spends more money importing fish than what it makes from producing it and exporting that production. Conversely, both Chile and Peru have a trade surplus from their fisheries, with Peru the most “profitable” country (Table 7).

### Fisheries Context

#### Wild Caught Fish

##### Global Databases (FAO and SAU)


As previously mentioned, there are no national-level fisheries statistics data in Brazil since 2008. Therefore, the country-wide assessment was only possible using the SAU and FAO datasets. While these datasets provide information regarding landings by species, it is worth mentioning that they are far from realistic. In our meeting with Dr.Fabio Hazin, he pointed out that data from FAO on Brazilian fisheries is mostly extrapolated as-is from production in previous years, when reliability was already questionable. The figure showing the top 5 species fished in the country gives a clear picture of such extrapolation (Figure x)

According to both the FAO and SAU data, Brazil’s fisheries capture has been declining since 2012, though there has been increasing aquaculture production. The SAU database accounts for unreported catches in Brazil [@REF] and estimates around 50 thousand tonnes more captures than reported in FAO. These captures are important since they are mainly caught by the artisanal sector, hence contributing directly to food security [@SAUBrazil] (Table 8). 

```{r Brazil_Totals_T, eval=T,echo=F}

    Year,

    -Production
  ) %>% 
  kable(
      caption = "Summary of results for Brazil. Database used: SOFIA-FAO and SAU. Exploited species in quantity, other variables represent thousand tones"
    )

```

According to the SAU database *Macrodon ancylodon*,*Micropogonias furnieri*,*Sardinella brasiliensis"*,*Umbrina canosai*, and Ray fishes (*Baitoidea*) are the most landed fish between 2010 and 2014 (Figure 9). It is very likely that these fish are consumed in the country representing an important source of food.

###### Santa Catarina

The state of Santa Catarina is one of the main fisheries producers in the country. This state is home to the largest fisheries port in the country, **NAME**, concentrating most of Brazil’s industrial fleet (Figure 9). Landings data from this state are available since 2000, although from 2014-2016 catches are underreported due to lack of funding. Historic production from Santa Catarina has been over 100 thousand tonnes until 2013 and corresponds to about 18% of the total estimated landing from capture fisheries in Brazil (about 760 thousand tonnes). The main species caught in the state across all years are sardines, herring, croaker and skipjack tuna (Figure 9). Historical records of the main species caught show a clear declining trend in catch of sardines, a key food fish regionally and in the country (Figure 9).

###### São Paulo

The state of São Paulo has a continuous data collection program dating back from 1998 (Figure 10-A). Although this state is not the main fisheries producer in the country, landing average about 35 thousand tonnes per year (about 5% of the total estimated landing from capture fisheries in Brazil). 2017 was the year in which data collection program covered all regions in the state, which explains increased catches during this period. The main species caught in the state across all years were shrimps, crayfish and crabs (Figure 10-B). The fishing fleet from this state is mainly artisanal, with very few industrial boats.

#### Aquaculture Production

According to the Brazilian fish farming association (PeixeBR), the aquaculture industry is the fastest growing food production sector in the country (PeixeBR, 2018). Brazil has some the largest potential for aquaculture in the world and will become a significant producer of fish in the next years. Fish farming has been growing around 8% per year in recent years, with a large increase in farming of native fish, especially in the north and middle-west regions. Additionally, Brazil is the fourth largest producer of tilapia in the world, with rapidly growing industries in the south and northeast regions. Another important aquaculture industry in the country is shrimp farming in the northeast region, although it has not been growing the production in recent years (Table 12). According to PeixeBR, there was a total production of about 690k tones of fish from aquaculture in 2017 (plus about 80k of shrimp, which totals about 771k tones). Thus, aquaculture products are already an important source of seafood for Brazil and has the perspective to grow rapidly in the future.

      format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
      )
```

#### Fish Trade 

Despite large potential for seafood production from both capture fisheries and aquaculture, Brazil imports large quantities of seafood for domestic consumption. In 2017, Brazil imported more than 380 thousand tonnes of fish and seafood products, while exporting less than 10% of that value (Figure 11). Local production is clearly insufficient for meeting national seafood demand, and fish stock recoveries and increased aquaculture production are required to support national food security.

```


Fish and seafood import data shows that the main imported species in the last four years were salmon, followed by sardines, catfish (*Pangasius*) and hake (Table 13). There was a major increase in the import of sardines in the last two years, from 17 thousand tonnes imported in 2015 to 90 thousand tonnes in 2017. This increase is mainly result of the decline in sardine catches from the industrial fleet (Figure X above for Santa Catarina).

According to information from research developed about this fishery, about 100 thousand tonnes of sardine was landed in 2014 followed by a decline to about 20 thousand tonnes in 2017 (Pincinato and Asche 2018). According to the authors, this decline is mainly because of environmental variability in the south of Brazil and “El Niño” events that occurred during that period. Thus, Brazilian sardine and imports form a fully integrated market, which maintains a steady supply of sardines to canary industries year-round.

#### Fresh Water Fish in the Amazon

Fisheries production in Amazon state is exclusively from riverine systems and artisanal fisheries. According to estimates from the state government, production has remained stable over the last decade, totaling around 200 thousand tonnes per year (Figure 12). From the estimated production, about 40% of the catch is for subsistence of riverine communities.

### National Seafood Supply

Using data from FAO and quantity imported and exported, it is possible to estimate the amount of seafood that is consumed in Brazil per year. The estimated consumption of seafood in Brazil is based on 760 thousand tonnes from capture fisheries plus 750 thousand tonnes from aquaculture and 380 thousand tonnes from imports, minus 37 thousand tonnes for exports. This results in an estimated 1.86 million tonnes of seafood consumed in Brazil. Assuming equal consumption per capita for the total population of 200 million, this would suggest a yearly consumption of about 9.3 kg per capita.

**Top Fisheries by Domestic Consumption**

Domestic consumption of fish and seafood in Brazil is estimated to be around 10 kilograms per capita per year (@FAO2014). Per capita consumption in Brazil is low relative to other countries (average of 18 kg in the world) and the World Health Organization recommendation of 12 kg per capita. However, fish and seafood consumption has been steadily increasing from 4.6 kg per capita in 1961 to about 10 kg per capita in 2014 (FAO). Because of Brazil’s large population (about 200 million people), this sums up to large amounts of seafood being consumed in the country, although consumption significantly varies across regions of the country. Additionally, estimates from FAO do not account for subsistence consumption of fish, that in some regions of the Amazon can be as high as 169 kg/capita/year (@Isaacetal2015). According to estimates from the fisheries department of Amazon state, about 80 thousand tonnes of fish are caught for subsistence by riverine communities (Figure 12).

Data from CEAGESP market suggests that the main species consumed in Brazil in 2017 was sardine, followed by tilapia, croaker, salmon, sharks and weakfishes (Table xxx), supporting results from intergovernmental data analysis (see Table/Figure 14). Of these species, tilapia and salmon are produced through aquaculture and the remaining are from fisheries. In São Paulo market alone, 4.2 thousand tonnes of tilapia were traded, with a total for all fish and seafood products of 42 thousand tonnes in 2016 and 37 thousand  tonnes in 2017.

Data from SIGSIF shows that the main species processed in the country in 2017 was tilapia, followed by tambaqui or cachama (*Colossoma macropomum*), sardine, croaker, salmon, tambatinga (hybrid aquaculture species from the Amazon), catfish, and tuna (Table 15). From the top 10 species processed in the country, 5 are from aquaculture production and 5 are from wild caught fisheries. A total of 360k tonnes of fish and seafood products were commercialized by 472 processing and distribution companies. This volume corresponded to about 20% of all estimated seafood consumed in the country (1.8b tonnes).

Figure 13 shows the regional patterns of the data from seafood processing industries (SIGSIF). The map on the left (producers) shows the quantity of fish and seafood products that entered industries directly from producers (fisheries and aquaculture). This map provides insights on the main producing states and location of seafood industries. According to this map, the Rio de Janeiro state has the largest density of seafood industries in the country. The map on the right (commerce) shows the quantity of fish and seafood products received from other seafood industries. In other words, the map shows the exchange of products between seafood industries. Because the map shows the receiving sates, it provides important insights on the consumption of seafood products per region. It is important to highlight that Santa Catarina state shows high quantity of fish and seafood products received, but not necessarily means there is high consumption. This happens because Santa Catarina State is where most of the sardine and tuna canaries are located. Such canned products are produced in these states and then distributed and consumed all over the country.

Consumption of fish and seafood products in Brazil increases significantly during religious dates. Data from CEAGESP suggests that seafood consumption increases during Easter, when other types of meat are not consumed in respect of Catholic tradition. For this reason, there is a significant peak in fish and seafood consumption during Easter week (Figure 14).

Fish and seafood consumption in Brazil has distinct patterns according to the region of the country. As shown in IBGE data, the top consumers of fish and seafood products in the country are from the north and northeast regions (Figure 15-A). These regions are the poorest of the country (Figure 15-B) and have the greatest number of registered fishers [@MPA2013], especially from the small-scale sector. 

Since most of the artisanal production is consumed locally, these regions have greater availability of fish and seafood products relative to capitals far from fishing activities. In addition to greater availability of fish and seafood products, the North and Northeast regions of Brazil have, in general, greater tradition of consuming seafood products. Because of extensive areas of coastline, the northeast region has tradition of eating seafood in restaurants close to the ocean, especially in the summer. Similarly, the North region has extensive areas of rivers and coast, being part of the culture to eat fish and seafood products. In other parts of the country, people traditionally eat other types of protein. Brazil has historically been a agriculture and livestock production country, with large tradition of eating barbecue and bovine meat. In many places there are cultural barriers for regularly consuming fish and seafood products. However, with increased aquaculture production, many of these states are now producing more fish and as consequence are starting to eat more fish. In addition, people are increasingly aware of the health benefits derived from eating fish and seafood products. In summary, the north and northeast regions are the greatest consumers of fish and seafood in the country because of the availability and tradition of consuming fish and seafood products. Because these regions are the poorest of the country, fish and seafood products are crucial for food security, especially in coastal and riverine areas.

In the North and Northeast regions, where consumption of seafood is highest, it is important to distinguish resources that are important for food security in coastal and riverine areas. Generally, while the most valuable species are usually sold for profit, smaller and less valuable fish are consumed by fishers and their families. Hundreds of species are consumed in these regions, with very little information on the most important species for food security.

For those people not involved directly in fishing activity, consumption of fish and seafood products is expensive relative to other protein types (Figure 15-A). Fish and seafood products (R 32, \$US ~9) are on average three times more expensive than poultry (R 10, \$US ~3), twice the price of pig meat (R 15, \$US ~ 4) and 25% more expensive than cow meat (R 23.18, \$US ~6) [@InstituteofAgricultureEconomics-IEA2018]. Such difference in price ca explain in part the low consumption of fish and seafood products in Brazil, especially during an economic crisis. In many cases, consumption of fish and seafood products are mostly in restaurants as a "fancy" dinner and not a meat for the day-to-day life.

In addition to elevated prices, frozen seafood products available in supermarkets are many times unreliable and with poor quality. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, seafood fraud was detected in 21% of the fish sold in supermarkets. In addition, a preeminent newspaper article pointed out that 70% of frozen fillets sold in supermarkets had excess water, reaching up to one third of the total weight of the fish. This practice makes the product even more expensive and discourages people from buying seafood products [@FolhadeSP2008]. Therefore, for the average consumer, seafood products are expensive and unreliable relative to other protein options. This explains in part low seafood consumption levels in many parts of the country.

Data on the main species consumed in Brazil suggests that consumers are mostly driven by price, although there are some exceptions. From the top 10 seafood products sold in CEAGESP, 6 where below the 0.5 percentile of prices (Table 16). This indicates that the primary driver of domestic consumption is affordability. However, there are some expeditions, such as salmon, shark and shrimps. Consumption of these species are mainly driven by desirability, supplying high-end markets and restaurants. Species such as salmon and shrimp have high demand because of their distinct flavor and color. Other species, especially white fish can be more easily substituted by other similar fish.

The aquaculture industry in Brazil has been growing rapidly. In the North region, farmed fish is already affecting the market and reducing prices. Today, a large portion of the fish consumed in the region is produced by aquaculture. Tilapia is already the second most commercialized species in the CEAGESP market in São Paulo and the top species processed by seafood companies in the country. Cachuma (or Tambaqui) is a native species farmed in the north and mid-west regions and is the second most processed fish by seafood industries in Brazil. Therefore, with the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the country, the domestic supply of seafood will increase thus increasing accessibility of fish and seafood product for Brazil's population.

### National Economic Participation

Because there is no reliable national-level landings data in Brazil since 2008, it is challenging to determine the top fisheries by income generated in the country. Data available are mainly from the industrial sector, where sardines, croaker and tuna are the main species caught. However, information from the SIGSIF (Table 15) and Santa Catarina state landings does not have any information on price. 

A report by Nielsen analytic (Nielsen, 2018) shows that the canned sardine market in Brazil is valued at about 1.4 billion Brazilian Reais (approx. 380 million Dollars) and the canned tuna market is worth about 145 million Brazilian Reais (approx. 39 million Dollars). Additionally, according to the Brazilian seafood industry association, seafood industries have an aggregate revenue of 8 billion Brazilian Reais (approx. 2.2 billion Dollars) per year. These numbers demonstrate the strength of the seafood market (especially canned market) in Brazil and the importance of sardines for income and food security in the country.

Data from CEAGESP market have important information on the value of seafood in the country. This database contains quantity and price information for all seafood products. Products sold in the market are both from industrial and artisanal sectors. Table 17 shows the main species ranked by value sold in the CEAGESP market in 2017. The most valuable species in this year were sardines followed by sharks, croaker, tuna and acoupa weakfish (Table 17). 

Sharks are not distinguished by species and are captured by both artisanal and industrial fleets. Sardines, croakers and tunas are caught mainly by the industrial fleet, while the acoupa weakfish is mainly caught by artisanal fisheries from the north and northeast regions of Brazil. Snook is also one of the top 10 species sold in the market and mainly captured by the artisanal sector. It is one of the species with greater price in the market.

Many important small-scale resources are not sold in the CEAGESP market but are important sources of income through sale in local markets. Resources such as crabs, mullets, shrimp, snappers and groupers are very important sources of income for small-scale fishers. Only from our databases there are over 500 different species reported. For example, in São Paulo state most of the production is from small-scale fisheries sector. In this state, total fisheries value has increased in latest years, fluctuating at around one million reais per year (Figure 16-B). If we divide total value (1 million) by the number of registered fishers in the state (26k), there is an annual income of about 37k per fisher. In this state, shrimps, crab and crayfish are the most important species in terms of value (Table 16).

Another important piece of information regarding income generated are the main species exported in Brazil. Data from the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) show that the main species exported are lobsters, followed by other fish, swim bladders and pelagic fish (tunas and swordfish) (Table 19). The main species exported, lobsters, are caught exclusively by the artisanal sector, with resources threatened by over exploitation (according to the Ministry of Environment). Because of the high value, the lobster fishery is profitable even when the resource is depleted. Exports of lobsters in Brazil reached staggering US$ 73 million in 2017, with no reported landings of the species in the country.

#### Wild-caught Fish Employment

As pointed out in the introduction, Brazil has no reliable data on the number of fishers in the country. To respond this question we put together several pieces of information from different sources to have an estimate of the importance of fisheries for employment in Brazil. 

Data from IBGE (2013) estimated that Brazil had about 500 thousand fishers throughout the country, with 90% from the small-scale sector and 10% from the industrial sector [@CamposandChaves2016]. However, data from the extinct Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA) suggests there are many more fishers in Brazil (Figure 17). According to these data, there were about one million registered fishers in 2013 throughout the country, with about 95% of the registered fishers from the small-scale sector (MPA). There is a large discrepancy between these two sources, which reiterates the uncertainty around estimates of the number of fishers in the country.

##### Artisanal sector

Assuming that the number of fishers are between 500 thousand and 1 million, and that about 90% of them are from the small-scale sector, the most important fisheries for employment in the country are those from the artisanal sector. The artisanal sector is where we have the least amount of data on the production and species harvested. There is an estimate from the MPA that 50-70% of the catch from the entire country comes from the artisanal sector (MPA, 2013). Small-scale fisheries in Brazil target hundreds of species and there is no reliable information on the most important species for this sector. 

Most of the registered fishers in Brazil are from the North (37% of total registered fishers) and Northeast regions (52% of total registered fishers) (Figure 18) [@MPA2013]. In these regions, freshwater resources from the Amazon and estuarine fisheries are very important. From the Amazonas state, the top commercialized fish are: curimatã (*Prochilodus nigricans*), jaraqui (*Semaprochilodus spp.*), matrinchã (*Brycon amazonicus*), pacu *(Mylossoma duriventre*), tambaqui (*Colossoma macropomum*) and tucunaré (*Cichla monoculus*) (data from the secretary of fisheries in the Amazon state - @Sepror, 2018). In estuaries, there are many important resources such as the mangrove crabs, shrimps, bivalves, weakfish and snook (information gathered though literature review and interviews). Besides these fisheries, the small-scale fishers target all ecosystems and resources, such as pelagic, reefs, demersal and coastal. In the Northeast region for example, reef fisheries are very important, capturing some highly valued species such as snappers, groupers and lobsters. In the south, the mullet fishery is very important, with the first quota system for Brazil implemented in 2018 to manage this fishery. Therefore, the artisanal sector is a multi-species fishery, with the main species depending on the region and ecosystem.

Employment along the supply chain varies according to the region, fisheries and species commercialized. In the artisanal sector, most of the catch is consumed regionally, or in nearby capitals. However, some valuable fish and seafood are also commercialized in the main capitals - São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. These fish are sold through middleman and larger seafood industries to large capitals, thus involving a larger number of people in the supply chain. However, there is no reliable estimate on the total number of people employed in the supply chain of artisanal fisheries. The MPA estimates that there are about two million people involved in these fisheries (MPA, 2013). 

##### Industrial sector

Industrial fisheries in Brazil employ only about 5% of the fishers and is responsible for about 30-50% of the fisheries production. The industrial sector in Brazil is mainly concentrated in the south of the country, especially in Santa Catarina state where the main industrial fisheries port is located (*Itajai port)*. Landings data from Santa Catarina state indicate that sardines are the most important species, followed by corvina and skipjack tuna (Table 20). Another important industrial fisheries fleet is located in the mouth of the Amazon river, in the north of Brazil. The main resource captured in the region is the catfish piramutaba (*Brachyplatystoma vaillantii*), although there is no data available from this fleet. Therefore, the top fisheries by employment in the industrial sector are represented in the landings data from the Santa Catarina state and the piramutaba fishery in the north.

In the industrial sector, the majority of the catch is processed by large companies to be distributed in supermarkets and restaurants all over the country. According to data published by the Seafood Industry Association (ABIPESCA), the seafood industry employs about 8 thousand direct employments and 30 thousand indirect employments. Data from the seafood companies (SIGSIF) indicates that the most important industrial fisheries are sardines, croacker, tuna and piramutaba catfish (Table 20). Thus, the industrial sector employs relatively less people per tonne of captured fish compared to the artisanal sector.

## Results Chile

### Fisheries Context

To evaluate the volume contribution of specific fisheries over the last five years, we used records of landings and aquaculture harvests from SERNAPESCA  (2013-2017). Using monthly data  published by IFOP, we identified the most exported fish products in terms of volume. To identify the participation of different species in exported volumes we generated a new database linking types of products listed in the *Arancel Aduanero* with the names of the fished and farmed species listed by SERNAPESCA. We searched for all the products ids that refer to the species scientific name, common name or genus name as listed by SERNAPESCA and aggregated them under the species name.

#### Wild Caught Fish

##### Main wild-caught fisheries in terms of volume 

According to landing records from SERNAPESCA over the last five years, the artisanal sector lands on average 1.6 ± 0.58 million annual tons of marine species while the industrial sector lands around 0.9 ± 0.16 million tons per year. Is worth noting that the artisanal sector includes landings of algae and Bentham species that are not targeted by the industrial sector. Both sectors have among their most landed species the Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) and the Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*) two species that are mostly used as inputs for fish meal and oil (Figure 19). Other important species in artisanal landings are the Giant grey kelp (*Lessonia nigrescens*), exported mostly as dried algae, and the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), mostly commercialized fresh or frozen for HC. The Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*) is also an important fishery in terms of volume for the industrial sector, which is also mostly use in the production of fish meal and oil and to a lesser extent use for direct HC smoked or canned.

Over the last years the catch composition of the artisanal sector has presented no major changes except from one species of algae (Giant brown kelp, *Lessonia trabeculata*) replacing other (Red algae gracilaria, *Gracilaria spp*) within the top 5 landed species as for 2013. In the case of the industrial sector, composition of the main three species seem to be stable over the last five years. Yet, the South pacific hake (*Merlucius gayi*) stooped being one of the species most fished by the industrial sector after 2013. This can be explained by the reduction of the total allowable catch for this species given its risk of collapse in those years (@subpesca_cuota_2013). After 2013, the industrial sector introduced the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) among its top 5 landed species. As for 2016 the Chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) has entered the top 5 for the industrial sector replacing Patagonian grenadier (*Macruronus magellanicus*). Other important species are the *mote sculpin* and different algae for the artisanal sector (Table 21).

##### Regional Diferences in volumes of wild-caught fisheries

Landed tons for 2017 shows that the amount of landings varies widely along the coast of Chile for both artisanal and industrial sectors. Figure 20 show the mean total landing per sector and region. The color of the bars represents the most landed species in 2017. We observe that the VIII region is by far the region with most landings from both sectors. However, the industrial sector also concentrate landings in the north of the country while artisanals are more spread. The most landed species in 2017 also varies by region but has changed little over the last five years (**Table App.3** and **Table App.4**). 

```{r Landings_per_region, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= 'Mean annual total landings per region for the artisanal (left pannel) and industrial sector (right pannel) between 2013 and 2017.

#### Aquaculture production

##### Main farmed fisheries in terms of volume

The main species harvested from aquaculture centers in the last 5 years have been the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), Coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*), mussels (*Mytilus chilensis*) and the Red algae gracilaria (*Gracilaria spp.*) in descending order (Figure 21). Overall, the composition of the most farmed species and its volumes have been stable over the last 5 years. However, the Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) seems to be becoming less important over recent years.

##### Regional Diferences in farmed fisheries

Aquaculture production is highly concentrated in the South of the country, between the X and the XII regions (Figure 22). Nevertheless, from the I to the IV region the most farmed resources are algaes and scallops (*Argopecten purpuratus*) (**Table App.5**). The red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) became the most farmed in 2013 in the V region, replacing the Turbot (*Scophtalmus maximus*). Towards the south salmons and trouts are the most farmed species along with some algaes and mussels (*Mytilus chilensis*). The most farmed species in the austral south are the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) and the Chilean mussel (*Mytilus chilensis*).

#### Fish Trade
 
Around 72% of the landings from fisheries and aquaculture are exported outside the country (@ifop_monitoreo_2015). The main species exported is Atlantic salmon produced in aquaculture, followed by far by jack mackerel (Figure 23-A). Tuna leads the import activities followed, also by far, by jack mackerel (Figure 23-B)

### National Seafood Supply

Chile is considered one of the main countries in fishery production worldwide (@fao_estado_2016), however several reports and studies suggest the Chilean population does not consume as many marine products (@gonzales_solo_2018). On average, people consume 10-13 kg a year, compared to the 20 kg a year recommended by Food and Agriculture organization (2016). Looking into what type of seafood the Chilean population consumes, a study done in 2012 shows that 60% of the seafood consume are pelagic fishes, 12% are mollusk and 2% are crustaceans (@villena_marcelo_diagnostico_2012).

According to the National Health Survey (Encuata Nacional de Salud, ENS), only 9.2% of the Chilean population eats fish at least two times a week as recommended. This value has decreased since the early 2000s where this percentage was 10.7% (@ENS). World data (@ritchie_our_nodate) also shows a decrease in the amount of percapita seafood consumed by the Chilean population from ~16kg consumed in 2004 to 12.5kg in 2013.

The frequency of seafood consumption varies along socio-economic groups in Chile, according to a study done in 2016 by Fundación Chile and Adimark (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016), 55% of the high-income group consumes seafood at least once a week compared to the 38% of the lower-income group. It has also been identified (@ENE) that people with less years of schooling tend to eat less fish (only 6.3 percent eats seafood twice a week) than people that have completed high school education, where 11.2% eats as frequently. 

Within the Chilean population there is a strong belief that seafood is expensive. However, there is wide range of fish prices. There are expensive products such as salmon or lobsters and affordable alternatives such as Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo Flying Squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) and Southern Rays Bream (*Brama australis*) (@ENE).


#### Species contribution to Human and Non-human consumption

As a first approach to analyzed main fisheries that countribute to human conssumption in Chile, we looked into landings, aquaculture harvest and raw material that goes to processing facilities. Our results show that considering landing plus aquiculture harvest, the main species that enter supply chains of HC are the Atlantic Slamon (*Salmo salar*) and the Chilean Mussel (*Mytilus chilensis*), two of the main aquaculture products from Chile (Figure sp_HC_with_Aq). On the other hand species that are used for non-human consumptions are Peruvian Anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) Araucarian Herring (*Strangomera bentincki*), the two main wild-caught fisheries of the country (Figure Figure sp_HC_with_Aq). The contribution of each specie to human consumption and non human consumption is relativly stable through time.

```

Within the wild-cought species, the one that have historically contributed more to human consumption products are: Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and in a minor contribution Sea Urchins (*Loxechinus albus*) (Figure sp_HC_no_Aq). These results also shows that the amount of wild caught fiheries that go to non-human consumption is more than the double and some years the triple of what that goes to human consumption.


```{r figure species for HC, echo= FALSE, eval=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap= "Main species landed that are designated for human consumption"}
sp_HC_no_Aq
```

In Chile, almost all industrial landings ($L_i$) and aquaculture harvest ($Aq$) go to processing facilities while only some of the artisanal landing ($L_a$) is processed. We assume that the the artisanals' catch that is not sent to processing facilities is sold as non-processed products for human consumption ($NP_{HC}$). These approach allowed us to analyze main species sold by artisanal fisher and we assumed it is all for human consumption. Species vary across years, but the Southern rays bream (*Brama australis*) is the only specie that is common for every year of data (Figure NP_HC_plot). Indicating that historically has been an importat specie for direct human consumption. This aligns with results obtained in a survey implemented along Chile where 51% answered that Southern rays bream was their first preference (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016). Within 2013, 2014 and 2016, we can see the presence of anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), while in 2017 there is high increase in Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*). We identified that data per sector provided by SERNAPESCA for 2015  was not accurate therefore remeoved it for this analysis.

#### Main fisheries for food supply

To identify the main fisheries for human food supply in Chile we combined datasets from landings, aquaculture, raw material that goes into facilities for non-human consumption, imports and exports. Assuming that all local landings and harvest that is not processed as non-human consumption products or exported is comsumed locally. Eventhough landings and aquaculture databases are detailed at a species level, we agragated the data in larger groups (See appendix) to be able to combine them with the Chilean Customs datasets. Our results show, that the main fishery for local consumption across the years has been squid. Within this group we considered: Patagonian squid (*Loligo gahi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), Argentine shortfin squid (*Illex argentinus*) and Japanese flying squid (*Todarodes Pacificus*). These species predominate local consumption from 2013 to 2017, however, we found that in 2017 there was an increase in the exports of this group of species, therefore explaining their relatively less contribution to domestic consumption. Other local fisheries important for domestic human consumption in Chile are Hakes (Southern hake *Merluccius australis*, South Pacific hake *Merluccius gayi gayi*, Patagonian grenadier *Macruronus magellanicus*, Southern blue whiting *Micromesistius australis*) and Southern rays bream (*Brama australis*) (Figure top5_hc_fig_Lan). It is important to mention that the Southern rays bream is classified on its own group, therefore its relative contribution to domestic consumption is higher compered to other aggregated groups. Another caviet to make here is that squids have a the highest yield of all species, therfore there contribution to domestic consumption per landed ton is higher, partly explining its high predominance in our results.  

Our models show the chilean population also consumes high volumens of Tuna, however this is mainly imported in a canned format. This results aliged with the chilean population preferences, based on a study along the country, where 84% of the respondee aswered that their normal format for eating fish within a month was canned fish, follwed by freshed fish (80%) and frozen fish (37%) (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016). The ten most importat fisheries according to our model are shown in table XX in the appendix.

#### Total and per capita food consumption in the country
Our models is highly sensitive to species yield, therefore not in many cases results of our calculations return a negative number implaying that exports are higher than the product of the yield times the local production (landings nad aquaculture) minus all tons that go for non-human consumption products. Assuming that all negative numbers do not contribut to domestic consumption (all of the product is exported and non is imported), we calculated a percapita consumption per year. 
We summed all the human consumption per year (Table XX) and devided by the chilean population of 17,762,681 (@INE, 2015). Results aling with what has been calculated in by others studies with an average of 11.5 kg of seafood compsumption a year, which is similar to what has been estimated by the FAO (2016) for Chile of 10-13kg of fish a year.

```{r eval=F}

kable_styling(latex_options = 'hold_position') %>% 
  column_spec(4, width = "6cm")

```



#### Regional differences in per capita and total consumption
We where not able to do a regional analysis. Even though most of the data is provided at a regional level. We realized that is was not possible to assume that what was landed in a region was processed in that same area. According to a study done along the Chilean coast, 62% of the population from the north declares to eat fish once a week. in the north centre region that numbers decreases to 54% and it reaches its lowest point in the Metropolitan Region (42%). In the center south, 48% each fish at least once a week while in the south 48% (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016)

### National Economic Participation

Fisheries, as an economic sector in Chile, considers activities of extraction and farming of marine and freshwater products. This sector contributes to around 0.4% of the national GDP although it is a highly variable sector (@central_cuentas_2017). An estimate of 2014, indicates that 90% of the sales of the sector came from farmed products (@sence_reporte_2015). What reflects the relevance of aquaculture in economic terms relative to wild fisheries. Yet, the extractive sector has a higher number of firms, 58% of the total (@sence_reporte_2015). Fishing manufacturing is closely relates to fisheries. Based on the last input-output matrix for the country's economy, for every 100 US dollars spent in the fisheries sector, another 52.2 dollars are generated in the manufacturing sector. Other sectors affected by fisheries are the financing sector (24.8 dollars generated every 100) and transportation and communication (13.4 dollars generated every 100). 

#### Wild-caught Fish Economic Participation

The contribution of fisheries to regional GDP suggests that the economic importance of the sector to regional economies varies widely. Ranging from almost 30% in the XI region to 0% in the metropolitan (RM) and IX region (Figure 23).  

```{r Fisheries_PIB_Chile_G, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap= 'Percent of the regional GDP contirbuted by the fisheries sector averaging data between 2013 and 2016. Data source: Banco Central de Chile.'}

Based on our estimates of species-specific revenue the most important species for the artisanal sector are the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*) (Figure 23). Nonetheless, this varies across years. In 2017 the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) and the Southern rays bream or Corvina (*Brama australis*) were the species that provided more revenue followed by the Pink cusk-eel (*Genypterus blacodes*) in the artisanal sector.

Some of these species are among the most expensive (*Table App.6*). The Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) has the highest mean ex-vessel price in the artisanal sector what explains in part why is one of the top 5 in term of revenues. We should notice that the fishing costs for different types of species could vary widely and we are not accounting for this in our analysis. Yet, we can qualitatively consider the costs of different types of fishing. For example, some of these species are fished by diving near the shore like the Chilean abalone (*Concholepas concholepas*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*) while others like the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*), the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) or the Swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*) involve offshore fishing, which tends to be much more expensive. The gathering of algae from the shore is arguably one of the less costly extractive activities for the artisanal sector but it is not among the ones that generate more revenue. We could not generate similar estimates for the industrial and aquaculture subsectors due to lack of data.

#### Trade Economic Participation

Seafood products are one of the most important exports of the country. IFOP valued the exportation of fisheries-related products in $6,280 million dollars in 2017 (@ifop_boletines_2017). This corresponded to ~ 9 % of the total value of national exportation. The most important exported species are the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), the Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) and the Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*)(*Figure 6*). All three produced via aquaculture. Mussels, specifically the Chilean Ribbed Mussel (*Aulacomya ater*) and the Chorus mussels (*Choromytilus chorus*) are also among the most valuable exports. These are landed by artisanal fishers and to a lesser extent produced in aquaculture centers. 

The most valuable sea products in terms of exports are frozen and fresh followed by fish meal and dried algae (@ifop_boletines_2017). In 2016, fish fillets were the fourth most exported product by Chile. This commodity generates around 2 billion US dollar per year and is mainly made of farmed salmon (@datachile_fish_2016).

#### Fish and Aquaculture Employment

Fisheries and aquaculture are considered to be the activities that provide less direct employment in the country after agriculture (@sense_reporte_2015). Yet, the number of people employed in the sector has been on the rise since 2010 (@sence_reporte_2015). We estimated a total of ~ 278,000 job positions generated by fisheries and aquaculture. This estimate considers artisanal and industrial fishers, workers in processing facilities and aquaculture centers and indirect jobs generated by the manufacturing sector (*Table 2*). It does not include other indirect jobs generated by the extractive activities and its commercialization. Thus, the number of total people directly and indirectly employed by fisheries and aquaculture in Chile could be higher. 

```{r Employment_Chile_T, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}

kable_styling(latex_options = 'hold_position') %>% 
  column_spec(4, width = "6cm") #%>% #wraps text in column2

```

People employed in the fisheries and aquaculture activities have an average monthly income of 579 US dollars, the lowest mean income in the country after the one generated by the agricultural sector (@sence_reporte_2015). This value ranges from 258 US dollars for people working independently and part-time to 1,160 US dollars for full-time employers (*Table App. 7*).

On average, people employed in the fisheries and aquaculture sector are a younger and less educated relative to the national average and are mostly men (*Table App. 8*). However, there is high variation within subsectors, for example, artisanal fishers tend to be older @tam_gone_2018. Based on estimates from the New national survey of employment (NENE, 2015) only 57.7% of the people employed in the sector is formally employed by an employer, the rest work independently (@sense_reporte_2015).

#### Employment in the Artisanal Sector

The artisanal sector corresponds to fishing activities performed by vessels equal to or smaller than 18 meters in length and by collectors in the inter-tidal zone (@subpesca_panorama_2018). Based on the current RPA, there are around 89,000 artisanal fishers along with 12,700 vessels in Chile. *Figure X-A*, shows the number of artisanal fishers per region and gender. They are concentrated in the X and VIII regions and are mostly men. The main activity in the artisanal sector is harvester or collector, this mostly corresponds to algae collection on the shore. All regions present similar composition of fishing activities (*Figure X-B*). However, the X region seems to rely more on benthic resources for employment than the others since they have a greater share of divers and algae collectors.

#### Employment in the Industrial Sector

The industrial sector comprises activities performed by vessels larger than 18 meters. Currently, there are 475 industrial vessels and 164 vessel owners according to national industrial records (RPI), from which only 25 are individual owners and the rest are firms (@maturana_mujeres_2017). Besides, 3,500 jobs are generated through vessels operations (@subpesca_pesca_2018). We could only find information on the distribution of vessels (*Figure 8*). We observe that most industrial  extractive activities occur in the VIII region, as suggested by landings estimates discussed above. Still, vessels are registered along the entire coast. Some of the firms that own industrial vessels also own processing facilities whose employees are considered as part of the manufacturing stage.

#### Employment in the Industry

A rigorous study by IFOP estimated a total of ~50,000 job positions in the manufacturing of marine products in processing facilities in 2014 (@ifop_monitoring_2015). However, a more recent report form SERNAPESCA reports a total of 65,451 jobs (@maturana_mujeres_2017). *Figure 9* displays the geographic distribution of people employed in the manufacturing sector per gender and type of product for 2015. Employment in the processing facilities is dominated by human consumption (HC) products, with ~ 40,000 job positions. Products for animal consumption (AC) generated around 5,000 positions while algae products employed less than 3,000 people. Most people employed by the manufacturing sector are located in the southern part of the country and the majority are men.

### National Seafood Supply

Chile is considered one of the main countries in fishery production worldwide (@fao_estado_2016), however several reports and studies suggest the Chilean population does not consume as many marine products (@gonzales_solo_2018). On average, people consume 10-13 kg a year, compared to the 20 kg a year recommended by Food and Agriculture organization (2016). Looking into what type of seafood the Chilean population consumes, a study done in 2012 shows that 60% of the seafood consume are pelagic fishes, 12% are mollusk and 2% are crustaceans (@villena_marcelo_diagnostico_2012).

According to the National Health Survey (Encuata Nacional de Salud, ENS), only 9.2% of the Chilean population eats fish at least two times a week as recommended. This value has decreased since the early 2000s where this percentage was 10.7% (@ENS). World data (@ritchie_our_nodate) also shows a decrease in the amount of percapita seafood consumed by the Chilean population from ~16kg consumed in 2004 to 12.5kg in 2013.

The frequency of seafood consumption varies along socio-economic groups in Chile, according to a study done in 2016 by Fundación Chile and Adimark (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016), 55% of the high-income group consumes seafood at least once a week compared to the 38% of the lower-income group. It has also been identified (@ENE) that people with less years of schooling tend to eat less fish (only 6.3 percent eats seafood twice a week) than people that have completed high school education, where 11.2% eats as frequently. 

Within the Chilean population there is a strong belief that seafood is expensive. However, there is wide range of fish prices. There are expensive products such as salmon or lobsters and affordable alternatives such as Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo Flying Squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) and Southern Rays Bream (*Brama australis*) (@ENE).


#### Species contribution to Human and Non-human consumption

As a first approach to analyzed main fisheries that countribute to human conssumption in Chile, we looked into landings, aquaculture harvest and raw material that goes to processing facilities. Our results show that considering landing plus aquiculture harvest, the main species that enter supply chains of HC are the Atlantic Slamon (*Salmo salar*) and the Chilean Mussel (*Mytilus chilensis*), two of the main aquaculture products from Chile (Figure sp_HC_with_Aq). On the other hand species that are used for non-human consumptions are Peruvian Anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*) Araucarian Herring (*Strangomera bentincki*), the two main wild-caught fisheries of the country (Figure Figure sp_HC_with_Aq). The contribution of each specie to human consumption and non human consumption is relativly stable through time.

Within the wild-cought species, the one that have historically contributed more to human consumption products are: Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and in a minor contribution Sea Urchins (*Loxechinus albus*) (Figure sp_HC_no_Aq). These results also shows that the amount of wild caught fiheries that go to non-human consumption is more than the double and some years the triple of what that goes to human consumption.

In Chile, almost all industrial landings ($L_i$) and aquaculture harvest ($Aq$) go to processing facilities while only some of the artisanal landing ($L_a$) is processed. We assume that the the artisanals' catch that is not sent to processing facilities is sold as non-processed products for human consumption ($NP_{HC}$). These approach allowed us to analyze main species sold by artisanal fisher and we assumed it is all for human consumption. Species vary across years, but the Southern rays bream (*Brama australis*) is the only specie that is common for every year of data (Figure NP_HC_plot). Indicating that historically has been an importat specie for direct human consumption. This aligns with results obtained in a survey implemented along Chile where 51% answered that Southern rays bream was their first preference (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016). Within 2013, 2014 and 2016, we can see the presence of anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), while in 2017 there is high increase in Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*). We identified that data per sector provided by SERNAPESCA for 2015  was not accurate therefore remeoved it for this analysis.

#### Main fisheries for food supply

To identify the main fisheries for human food supply in Chile we combined datasets from landings, aquaculture, raw material that goes into facilities for non-human consumption, imports and exports. Assuming that all local landings and harvest that is not processed as non-human consumption products or exported is comsumed locally. Eventhough landings and aquaculture databases are detailed at a species level, we agragated the data in larger groups (See appendix) to be able to combine them with the Chilean Customs datasets. Our results show, that the main fishery for local consumption across the years has been squid. Within this group we considered: Patagonian squid (*Loligo gahi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), Argentine shortfin squid (*Illex argentinus*) and Japanese flying squid (*Todarodes Pacificus*). These species predominate local consumption from 2013 to 2017, however, we found that in 2017 there was an increase in the exports of this group of species, therefore explaining their relatively less contribution to domestic consumption. Other local fisheries important for domestic human consumption in Chile are Hakes (Southern hake *Merluccius australis*, South Pacific hake *Merluccius gayi gayi*, Patagonian grenadier *Macruronus magellanicus*, Southern blue whiting *Micromesistius australis*) and Southern rays bream (*Brama australis*) (Figure top5_hc_fig_Lan). It is important to mention that the Southern rays bream is classified on its own group, therefore its relative contribution to domestic consumption is higher compered to other aggregated groups. Another caviet to make here is that squids have a the highest yield of all species, therfore there contribution to domestic consumption per landed ton is higher, partly explining its high predominance in our results.  

Our models show the chilean population also consumes high volumens of Tuna, however this is mainly imported in a canned format. This results aliged with the chilean population preferences, based on a study along the country, where 84% of the respondee aswered that their normal format for eating fish within a month was canned fish, follwed by freshed fish (80%) and frozen fish (37%) (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016). The ten most importat fisheries according to our model are shown in table XX.

#### Total and per capita food consumption in the country
Our models is highly sensitive to species yield, therefore in many cases results of our calculations return a negative number implaying that exports are higher than the product of the yield times the local production (landings and aquaculture) minus all tons that go for non-human consumption products. Assuming that all negative numbers do not contribut to domestic consumption  because all of the product is exported and non is imported, we calculated a percapita consumption per year. We summed all the human consumption per year (Table XX) and devided by the chilean population of 17,762,681 (@INE, 2015). Results aling with what has been calculated in by others studies with an average of 11.5 kg of seafood compsumption a year, which is similar to what has been estimated by the FAO (2016) for Chile of 10-13kg of fish a year.

```{r eval=F}
##Percapita consumption table

kable(per_capita_total_Lan, col.names = c('Year', 'Total Human Consumption (tons)', 'Per-capita consumption/year (kg)'), format.args = list(decimal.mark = '.', big.mark = ","),"latex", booktabs = T, caption= 'Total tones of seafood for humanc consumption and per-capita consumption per year (kg) considering a popilation of 17,762,681 individuals') %>% 
kable_styling(latex_options = 'hold_position') %>% 
  column_spec(4, width = "6cm")


```



#### Regional differences in per capita and total consumption
We where not able to do a regional analysis for domestic consuption. Even though most of the data is provided at a regional level. We realized that is was not possible to assume that what was landed in a region was processedand then exported in that same area. Nor that the imports per area accounted for the actual imported food consumed in theregions. Looking into a study done in 2016, along the Chilean coast, 62% of the population from the north declares to eat fish once a week. in the north centre region that numbers decreases to 54% and it reaches its lowest point in the Metropolitan Region (42%). In the center south, 48% each fish at least once a week while in the south 48% (@fundacion_chile_chile_2016)

### National Economic Participation

Fisheries, as an economic sector in Chile, considers activities of extraction and farming of marine and freshwater products. This sector contributes to around 0.4% of the national GDP although it is a highly variable sector (@central_cuentas_2017). An estimate of 2014, indicates that 90% of the sales of the sector came from farmed products (@sence_reporte_2015). What reflects the relevance of aquaculture in economic terms relative to wild fisheries. Yet, the extractive sector has a higher number of firms, 58% of the total (@sence_reporte_2015). Fishing manufacturing is closely relates to fisheries. Based on the last input-output matrix for the country's economy, for every 100 US dollars spent in the fisheries sector, another 52.2 dollars are generated in the manufacturing sector. Other sectors affected by fisheries are the financing sector (24.8 dollars generated every 100) and transportation and communication (13.4 dollars generated every 100). 

#### Wild-caught Fish Economic Participation

The contribution of fisheries to regional GDP suggests that the economic importance of the sector to regional economies varies widely. Ranging from almost 30% in the XI region to 0% in the metropolitan (RM) and IX region (Figure 23).  

```{r Fisheries_PIB_Chile_G, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap= 'Percent of the regional GDP contirbuted by the fisheries sector averaging data between 2013 and 2016. Data source: Banco Central de Chile.'}

```

Based on our estimates of species-specific revenue the most important species for the artisanal sector are the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*) (Figure 23). Nonetheless, this varies across years. In 2017 the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) and the Southern rays bream or Corvina (*Brama australis*) were the species that provided more revenue followed by the Pink cusk-eel (*Genypterus blacodes*) in the artisanal sector.

Some of these species are among the most expensive (*Table App.6*). The Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) has the highest mean ex-vessel price in the artisanal sector what explains in part why is one of the top 5 in term of revenues. We should notice that the fishing costs for different types of species could vary widely and we are not accounting for this in our analysis. Yet, we can qualitatively consider the costs of different types of fishing. For example, some of these species are fished by diving near the shore like the Chilean abalone (*Concholepas concholepas*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*) while others like the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*), the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) or the Swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*) involve offshore fishing, which tends to be much more expensive. The gathering of algae from the shore is arguably one of the less costly extractive activities for the artisanal sector but it is not among the ones that generate more revenue. We could not generate similar estimates for the industrial and aquaculture subsectors due to lack of data.

#### Trade Economic Participation

Seafood products are one of the most important exports of the country. IFOP valued the exportation of fisheries-related products in $6,280 million dollars in 2017 (@ifop_boletines_2017). This corresponded to ~ 9 % of the total value of national exportation. The most important exported species are the Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), the Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) and the Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*)(*Figure 6*). All three produced via aquaculture. Mussels, specifically the Chilean Ribbed Mussel (*Aulacomya ater*) and the Chorus mussels (*Choromytilus chorus*) are also among the most valuable exports. These are landed by artisanal fishers and to a lesser extent produced in aquaculture centers. 

The most valuable sea products in terms of exports are frozen and fresh followed by fish meal and dried algae (@ifop_boletines_2017). In 2016, fish fillets were the fourth most exported product by Chile. This commodity generates around 2 billion US dollar per year and is mainly made of farmed salmon (@datachile_fish_2016).

#### Fish and Aquaculture Employment

Fisheries and aquaculture are considered to be the activities that provide less direct employment in the country after agriculture (@sense_reporte_2015). Yet, the number of people employed in the sector has been on the rise since 2010 (@sence_reporte_2015). We estimated a total of ~ 278,000 job positions generated by fisheries and aquaculture. This estimate considers artisanal and industrial fishers, workers in processing facilities and aquaculture centers and indirect jobs generated by the manufacturing sector (*Table 2*). It does not include other indirect jobs generated by the extractive activities and its commercialization. Thus, the number of total people directly and indirectly employed by fisheries and aquaculture in Chile could be higher. 

```{r Employment_Chile_T, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}

```

People employed in the fisheries and aquaculture activities have an average monthly income of 579 US dollars, the lowest mean income in the country after the one generated by the agricultural sector (@sence_reporte_2015). This value ranges from 258 US dollars for people working independently and part-time to 1,160 US dollars for full-time employers (*Table App. 7*).

On average, people employed in the fisheries and aquaculture sector are a younger and less educated relative to the national average and are mostly men (*Table App. 8*). However, there is high variation within subsectors, for example, artisanal fishers tend to be older @tam_gone_2018. Based on estimates from the New national survey of employment (NENE, 2015) only 57.7% of the people employed in the sector is formally employed by an employer, the rest work independently (@sense_reporte_2015).

#### Employment in the Artisanal Sector

The artisanal sector corresponds to fishing activities performed by vessels equal to or smaller than 18 meters in length and by collectors in the inter-tidal zone (@subpesca_panorama_2018). Based on the current RPA, there are around 89,000 artisanal fishers along with 12,700 vessels in Chile. *Figure X-A*, shows the number of artisanal fishers per region and gender. They are concentrated in the X and VIII regions and are mostly men. The main activity in the artisanal sector is harvester or collector, this mostly corresponds to algae collection on the shore. All regions present similar composition of fishing activities (*Figure X-B*). However, the X region seems to rely more on benthic resources for employment than the others since they have a greater share of divers and algae collectors.

#### Employment in the Industrial Sector

The industrial sector comprises activities performed by vessels larger than 18 meters. Currently, there are 475 industrial vessels and 164 vessel owners according to national industrial records (RPI), from which only 25 are individual owners and the rest are firms (@maturana_mujeres_2017). Besides, 3,500 jobs are generated through vessels operations (@subpesca_pesca_2018). We could only find information on the distribution of vessels (*Figure 8*). We observe that most industrial  extractive activities occur in the VIII region, as suggested by landings estimates discussed above. Still, vessels are registered along the entire coast. Some of the firms that own industrial vessels also own processing facilities whose employees are considered as part of the manufacturing stage.

#### Employment in the Industry

A rigorous study by IFOP estimated a total of ~50,000 job positions in the manufacturing of marine products in processing facilities in 2014 (@ifop_monitoring_2015). However, a more recent report form SERNAPESCA reports a total of 65,451 jobs (@maturana_mujeres_2017). *Figure 9* displays the geographic distribution of people employed in the manufacturing sector per gender and type of product for 2015. Employment in the processing facilities is dominated by human consumption (HC) products, with ~ 40,000 job positions. Products for animal consumption (AC) generated around 5,000 positions while algae products employed less than 3,000 people. Most people employed by the manufacturing sector are located in the southern part of the country and the majority are men.

#### Employment in the Aquaculture Sector

There are 17,631 people employed among the 3,683 aquaculture centers currently registered in Chile (@maturana_mujeres_2017). From these, ~4,500 are women. *Figure 10* shows the distribution of aquaculture centers per region and type of farmed species. The main type of product being farmed is fish, mostly salmon, followed by mollusks and algae. The X region hosts more than half of the aquaculture centers in the country.

# Critical Analysis

## Chile

### Data Uncertainty and Gaps

Most of our analysis relied on publically available data collected by governmental institutions. Although national efforts towards transparency and better data collection have increased over the years, there are still sources of uncertainty and error. Clear evidence of the presence of error in our analysis are the negative estimates of domestic consumption we got for some species after substracting exports to all what was produced in the country. Negative estimates are not logic since a country cannot export more than what it has produced. We think that these estimates can be mainly explain by the presence of Illegal unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), non-perfect matching between databases, and lack of information on species-specific yields and ingredients composition of marine products. 

Particularly concerning is landing data since it is mainly generated via landings declarations. Fishers should announce their intention to land catch to the authority in charge, who must weight and certify the catch. Commercialization centers should not sell any kind of catch that is not certified. Thus, fishers have an incentive to report their landings. In addition, those fishers that do not declare their landings risk their permits and penalty fees. Still, these rules are poorly enforced generating incentives to underreport. IUU fishing occurs in Chile. In 2017, the five most seized species due to non-compliance with fishing regulations were the Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*), the Peruvian anchoveta (*Engraulis ringens*), the Giant grey kelp (*Lessonia nigrescens*), the Jumbo Flying Squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and the South pacific hake (*Merluccius gayi*). All of them are among the most landed species in the country. There has been recent efforts to generate estimates for IUU for some Chilean fisheries like Loco (*Concholepas concholepas*) (@oyanedel_illegal_2018) and the South pacific hake (@wwfchile_estimacion_2017). However, we did not include them in our analysis because they are not available for all species and including them only for the species that have been studied could have bias our results in a systematic way. IUU is not recorded in the landings database but products coming from IUU that are exported are likely to be recorded in the exports database. This could be making us to underestimate domestic consumption. 

The lack of consistency in data collection between and within agencies brings another source of uncertainty to our analysis. We found inconsistencies between two databases of landings published by SERNAPESCA in their website. They differed in the level at which data was aggregated. One data base was clasified per secto (artisanal, industria, fabric vessels) and the other was the summary for lanfings and aquaculture for each year pero region. When we aggregated the most detailed database to the same level as the anual summary database we observed differences in landing volumes for the year 2015. We considered this to be part of the measurement error involved in any process of data collection or data entry. We used the summary annual data dor our domestic human consumption model because it alinged more with amounts reported all other years.

A major challenge was to match trade and landings data. SERNAPESCA collects data under the common names while Aduanas Chile record exported and imported products under the international Harmonized System nomenclature. To overcome this issue we use the information provided by Aduanas Chile on the species contained in some types of products. This allowed us to aggregate products per groups of species and match volumes and values to landing record by SERNAPESCA. In addition, SERNAPESCA applies several variations of a species common name between databases. This difficults the calculation of aggregated estimates. We solve this by generating a dataset that categorize all the names currently used by SERNAPESCA under a common group among the import and export data (See appendix for group details). We designated the groups and did all the corresponfing matching, this step is prone to human error.

It is possible that we have overestimated exports volumes for some species since some products combine the species of interest with other ingredients. We could not account for this since we did not have data on the products composition on different ingredients. However, for the most exported products this is not a major issue since fish fillets and fresh products are usually almost 100% made by fish meat or shellfish. Similarly, we lacked data on species-specific yields to estimate how many Kg of a species translates into different marine products. To fill this gap, we use information from Peru on production yields and apply it to Chilean species. Some of them were excatly the same species but for those that did not present a match in Peru we use the yield of the most similar species. We found our analysis to be particularly sensitive to the values of species-specific yields, highlighting the importance of improving this aspect of the model.

A major information gap we identified is the lack of publically available data on ex-vessel prices and employment for the industrial sector. To our knowledge neither SERNAPESCA, IFOP nor SUBPESCA collect data on this regard. Thus, identifying what were the most valuable species for the industrial sector was not possible. An approach we were unable to apply due to time constraints is to derive ex-vessel prices from trade data (@melnychuk_reconstruction_2017). Contrary to what we expected, the fisheries sector for which we found most available information was the artisanal sector. We were able to get a count of the direct employment generated by the artisanal sector thanks to the National Record of Artisanal Fishers (RPA). Still, we cannot ensure we are not underestimating the number of people that rely on fishing. We know enforcement is weak specially in remote areas of the country therefore there is room for illigal activity. We were also able to estimate species-specific revenues by using landings and prices of first transactions. Finally, information on employees in processing facilities was also available. However, some values were unrealistic since they were larger than the entire population of the country. Thus, we prefered relied on a survey study performed by IFOP to fullfill this estimate.   

We also lacked data on the transportation of landings and products between Chilean regions and final destination. This prevented us from applying our model of food supply at the regional level. The problem is that the catch landed in one region could be processed in a different one and then the final product sold in a third region. Running the regional analysis without accounting for this issue would have led to incorrect estimates of food consumption. 

### Fisheries context

-  The most important fisheries in Chile in terms of landings have been Anchovy (*Engraulis ringens*), Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphy*i) and Araucanian herring (*Strangomera bentincki*) (*Figure 1*), all three of them mainly catch by the industrial fleet. This pelagic fishes are mainly used to produce fish meal therefore not for human consumption. 

### Seafood Consumption

**Key messages**:

- *Most importants species and products in terms of food consumption.*
- *Trends in food consumption.*
- *Lack of understanding on what species are the most important for domestic consumption.* 
- *Despite its massive production, aquaculutre is not a major source of food supply for the Chilean population. Most of its production is exported and the species being farmed either go to non-human consumption (algae) or are too expenssive to be accessed by lower income groups which is the population of interest in the contxt of food security.* 

We found that Chileans moslty rely on pelagic fisheries as their primary source for seafood. The most important groups of species for domestic food consumption are squids, tuna, hake, and the Southern ray beam. However, it is likely that we have overestimated squid consumption. It is worth noting that Tuna is mostly imported into the country while most of the species that are use in Chile for Human Consumption products like salmon, trouts and mussels are exported. This reflects the importance of market forces on world-wide seafood distirbution and supply. Salmon and trouts get better prices a broad and are too expensive for Chileans in general. 

Although our is just a preliminary approach, we found that Chilean Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*), Jumbo flying squid (*Dosidicus gigas*), and Sea Urchins (*Loxechinus albus*) are species that are being conssumed without going through processing facilities. We believe this species are mostly sold close to their landing points and therefore are important for coastal communities livelihoods.

Seafood consumption in Chile has been shown to be correlated with income, as in other parts of the world. However, the data is spotty and is provably missing some of the consumption that occurs in coastal communities.


### Economic participation

Aquaculuture is the most important activity in the fisheries sector in terms of economic value. Their profits come mainly from the exportation of salmon products. This positions salmons as the group of marine species that contribute the most to the country's economy. The Chilean jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyi*) and the Jumbo squid (*Dosidicus gigas*) are the wild-caught species that have contributed the most in exports over the pasts years. The latter is use for DHC and is targeted by both the artisanal an industrial sector. Yet, current discussion on closing access to the industrials to this fishery could bring consequences for both income and food supply. 

Among wild-caught fisheries the ones that seems to generate more revenues for the artisanal sector are the Southern king crab (*Lithodes santolla*) and the Chilean sea urchin (*Loxechinus albus*). While the first fishery occurs only in the South of the country, the latter is ditributed along the coast of Chile.

Although the direct employment in aquaculture centers is low relative to the number of artisanal fishers, it is very likely that an important share of the job positions in the manufacturing sector are being supported by aquaculture. Especially in the South where most job positions for manufacturing of human consumption products are concetrated. The role of Algaes in terms of employment for the artisanal sector is also worth notice. The revenues of most these species are not particularly high, however the lower costs of extraction relative to other types of fishing make algae collection an attractive form of livelihood for coastal communities.

### Methods

Any conversion from Chilean pesos to dollars was done by first converting the amount in Chilean pesos to its value in Chilean Units of account (UF, a monetary unit corrected by inflation) of the respective year. Then, transformed to the equivalent in 2018 Chilean pesos using the 2018 UF value and finally, converting the 2018 value in Chilean pesos to its equivalent in 2018 US dollars, based on the conversion for Dec, 2018 (1 US dollars corresponds to 676 Chilean pesos).
